{"samples": ["First, let's find out how long Tom spends sailing in one direction. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.\n\nNext, we'll find out how long it takes Tom to sail back. Since his speed is 10 miles per hour going to the destination and 6 miles per hour coming back, we can find the time it takes him to sail back by using the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nThe distance between the two points is the same, so it's 5 miles. Using Tom's speed going back, we have: time = 5 miles / 6 mph.\n\nTo find the time in hours, we can convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60: time = (5 miles / 6 mph) * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.4167 hours.\n\nTo convert this to minutes, we can multiply by 60: minutes = 0.4167 hours * 60 minutes = 25 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Tom 25 minutes to sail back.\n\nTherefore, the total time Tom spends sailing is 3 hours (going to the destination) + 25 minutes (coming back) = 3 hours and 15 minutes.

Marcell's roll-ups have a width of 3 roll-ups and a length of 14 roll-ups, so the area is 3 * 14 = 42 square roll-ups.\n\nTo find the average number of roll-ups they both ate, we need to find a common area. Since 1 square roll-up is equal to 1 roll-up, we can divide the total area for each person by the smaller dimension (width) and then add the results together.\n\nBeatrice's average number of roll-ups = Total area / Width = 48 / 2 = 24 roll-ups\nMarcell's average number of roll-ups = Total area / Width = 42 / 3 = 14 roll-ups\n\nThe average number of roll-ups they both ate is (24 + 14) / 2 = 18.5 roll-ups. Since it's not possible to eat a fraction of a roll-up, we can assume that they rounded their counts or made some mistakes, and the actual average number of roll-ups they ate is not exactly 18.5.\n\nHowever, if we want to find an answer based on the given information, the answer is 18.5 roll-ups.

What is the area of the circle?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe formula for the area of a circle is: Area = \u03c0 \u00d7 r\u00b2, where r is the radius. The radius is half the diameter, so r = 10 inches / 2 = 5 inches. The area of the circle is \u03c0 \u00d7 5\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square inches. Since 1 square inch = 15.708 square centimeters, the area of the circle is approximately 25\u03c0 \u00d7 15.708 = 153.94 square centimeters. The answer is approximately 153.94 square centimeters.\n\nQuestion: A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 inches. What are its length and width?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). In this case, the perimeter is 36 inches. Let's call the length \"L\" and the width \"W.\" We can write the equation as: 2(L + W) = 36. Solving for L, we get L = (36 - W) / 2. Since the length and width must be positive, W < 36 and L > 36 - W. By trial and error or by using the quadratic formula, we find that L = 12 inches and W = 6 inches. The answer is a length of 12 inches and a width of 6 inches.\n\nQuestion: A triangle has sides of length 5 inches, 6 inches, and 7 inches.

{"samples": ["First, let's find out how many bags the trader bought from the farmer. He paid $20 per bag, so the total cost of all the bags is $20 * Number of bags. The trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags, so the total revenue from selling all the bags is $30 * Number of bags. Since the profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, we can write the equation: $30 * Number of bags - $20 * Number of bags = $400. Solving for the number of bags, we get: Number of bags = $400 / ($30 - $20) = $400 / $10 = 40 bags. The answer is 40."]}

{"samples": ["Isabelle spent a total of $12 (on cake ingredients) + $43 (on birthday presents) + $15 (on decorations) + $4 (on invitations) + $22 (on goodie bags) = $86 on the party supplies. Since she split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, each person paid $86 (total spending) / 3 = $28.67 (rounded to two decimal places). However, since it's unlikely that they would pay in decimal amounts, a more reasonable answer would be to round up or down the total spending to the nearest whole number, and then divide by three to find the amount each person paid. For example, if Isabelle rounded down the total spending to $86, then each person would pay $28.67 \u2248 $29. If she rounded up to $87, then each person would pay $28.67 \u2248 $29.

{"samples": ["Let's denote the cost of a magazine as m. Since a magazine costs half as much as a book, the cost of a book is 2m. We know that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the cost of a pen is m - 1.\n\nWe have three unknowns (the cost of a magazine, a book, and a pen), but we have three equations:\n\n1. A magazine costs half as much as a book, so the cost of a book is 2m.\n2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the cost of a pen is m - 1.\n3. The total cost of a book, a magazine, and a pen is $4 + m + (m - 1) = 2m + m - 1 = 3m - 1.\n\nSince we have three unknowns and three equations, we can find the solution. We can see that the cost of a pen is m - 1, and we know that a pen costs $1.50, so m = $1.50 + 1 = $2.50. Therefore, the cost of a pen is $2.50 - 1 = $1.50.\n\nThe cost of a book is 2m = 2 * $2.50 = $5.\n\nThe cost of a magazine is m = $2.50 / 2 = $1.25.\n\nSo, the cost of the pen is $1.50, and Lyle pays $1.50 x 4 = $6 for 4 notebooks.

Since the train can't have a fraction of a day between services, we round down to the nearest whole number: 13 days. The answer is 13."]}
{"samples": ["First, let's find the amount of stuffing needed for one collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can find this by finding the midpoint between 8 pounds and 2 pounds. The midpoint between two numbers is the average of the two numbers, so the collie bed takes (8 + 2) / 2 = 5.5 pounds of stuffing.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. For the chihuahua beds, we know that each bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing, so 4 chihuahua beds take 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. For the collie beds, we know that each bed takes 5.5 pounds of stuffing, so 3 collie beds take 3 x 5.5 = 16.5 pounds of stuffing.\n\nThe total amount of stuffing needed is 8 pounds (for the chihuahua beds) + 16.5 pounds (for the collie beds) = 24.5 pounds. The answer is 24.5 pounds."]}

{"samples": ["Let's denote the price of the pen as p. Then the price of the paper is p + 1 < 3p. Solving this inequality for p, we get p < 1 or p > 1. Since the price of a pen is not negative, we have p > 1. Therefore, the price of the paper is p + 1 = 2p - 1.\n\nTheo spent p on the pen and p + 1 = 2p - 1 on the paper, so in total she spent p + (2p - 1) = 3p - 1. She gave the cashier $10, so her change is $10 - (3p - 1).\n\nTo find the value of p, we can use the fact that the price of the pen is greater than 1. For example, if the price of the pen is $2, then the price of the paper is $2 +1 = $3. This means that Theo spent $2 on the pen and $3 on the paper, for a total of $5. Since she gave the cashier $10, her change is $10 - $5 = $5.\n\nTherefore, the change Theo received depends on the price of the pen. If the price of the pen is $2, then her change is $5. If the price of the pen is $3, then her change is $4. And so on.\n\nIn general, if the price of the pen is p dollars, then Theo's change is $10 - (3p - 1) = 11 - 3p. The answer is an expression that depends on the price of the pen."]}

To find out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window (which is 20 feet off the ground), we need to find the day when the beanstalk is 20 feet or more tall.\n\nWe can calculate this by finding the day when the beanstalk's height is 20 * 2^n, where n is the number of days. We want to find the smallest integer value of n that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nDay 1: 4 feet\nDay 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet\nDay 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet\nDay 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet\nDay 5: 32 * 2 = 64 feet\nDay 6: 64 * 2 = 128 feet\nDay 7: 128 * 2 = 256 feet\n\nSince 256 > 20 * 2^3 (which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 20), the answer is that it takes 7 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."]}

If a 20-ounce bottle costs $2.50, how much does a 16-ounce bottle cost?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to find the cost per ounce for both sizes of soda. For the 12-ounce bottle, the cost is $1.50 and for the 20-ounce bottle, the cost is $2.50. To find the cost per ounce for the 12-ounce bottle, we divide the cost by the number of ounces: $1.50 / 12 = $0.125 per ounce. For the 20-ounce bottle, the cost per ounce is $2.50 / 20 = $0.125 per ounce. Since both sizes of soda cost the same per ounce, a 16-ounce bottle will also cost $0.125 per ounce.

We know that one can costs $1.50. Next, we need to find the cost of 67 cans, which is the amount contained in a 2-liter bottle. We multiply the cost of one can by the number of cans: $1.50 / can * 67 cans = $100.10. However, this answer is not reasonable, as it is much more than the typical cost of a 2-liter bottle of soda. This indicates that there is an error in the problem statement, as 67 12-ounce cans do not equal 2 liters. The answer is undefined.\n\nQuestion: A 12-ounce can of soda costs $1.50.

Since they paid 30% of the selling price, we have:\n\nCompany paid = Selling price * 30%\nCompany paid = $25,000 * 0.3\nCompany paid = $7,500 per car\n\nSo, the total cost of the 10 cars for the company was $7,500 * 10 = $75,000.\n\nNow, let's find out the profit James made from selling these cars. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost to the company:\n\nProfit = Selling price - Company paid\nProfit = $25,000 - $7,500\nProfit = $17,500 per car\n\nSince James got a 10% commission on the profits, we have:\n\nCommission = Profit * 10%\nCommission = $17,500 * 0.1\nCommission = $1,750 per car\n\nTo find out how much James made in total, we need to multiply the commission per car by the number of cars sold:\n\nTotal commission = Commission per car * Number of cars sold\nTotal commission = $1,750 * 10\nTotal commission = $17,500\n\nSo, James made a total commission of $17,500 from selling the 10 cars.

If a circular pond is to be built in the garden, its diameter is to be 4 meters. What is the area of the pond in square meters?\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the rectangle that will be occupied by the pond. We can calculate this by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle: 12 m * 8 m = 96 sq.m.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the circle that represents the pond. We can calculate this by using the formula for the area of a circle: A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is 4 meters, the radius is half of that: r = 4/2 = 2 meters. Plugging this into the formula, we get: A = \u03c0(2)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 sq.m.\n\nTo find the area of the pond, we need to subtract the area of the circle from the area of the rectangle: 96 sq.m - 4\u03c0 sq.m. Using a calculator, we can find that 4\u03c0 is approximately 12.57 sq.m. So, the area of the pond is 96 sq.m - 12.57 sq.m = 83.43 sq.m.\n\nTherefore, the area of the pond is approximately 83.43 square meters."]}

{"samples": ["First, find the temperature difference between day and night: 45 degrees (day) - 33 degrees (night) = 12 degrees. Then, determine how many logs it takes to heat the house up to the freezing point: since every log raises the temperature by 5 degrees, Carson needs to burn logs until the house is 32 degrees + 5 degrees = 37 degrees warmer than the night temperature. So, Carson needs to burn logs until the house is 12 degrees + 37 degrees = 49 degrees. To find out how many logs it takes to reach 49 degrees, divide the desired temperature by the temperature increase per log: 49 degrees / 5 degrees = 9.8.

{"samples": ["First, let's find out how many hours Tasha spent mowing Joe's lawn. Let x be the number of hours she spent mowing Joe's lawn. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as long, so she spent 3x hours mowing Kamala's lawn. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as long, so she spent 5x hours mowing Alba's lawn.\n\nThe total number of hours Tasha worked in the first week was x + 3x = 4x. The total number of hours she worked in the second week was x + 5x = 6x. The total number of hours she worked in both weeks was 4x + 6x = 10x.\n\nWe know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade. Since she earned $6 for mowing each lawn, the number of lawns she mowed is $80 / $6 = 13.33. Since she can't mow a fraction of a lawn, she must have mowed 13 lawns. This means she spent 13 hours on lawn mowing in total.\n\nTherefore, the number of hours she spent on selling lemonade is 10x - 13. The revenue from selling lemonade is $80 - ($6 * 13) = $80 - $78 = $2. Since this is not a reasonable amount, there seems to be an error in the problem statement.\n\nSo, the answer is not provided in this question."]}

What is the area of the circle?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the circle: radius = diameter / 2 = 10 inches / 2 = 5 inches.\n\nNext, we can calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = \u03c0 * r^2 = \u03c0 * 5^2 = 25\u03c0 square inches.\n\nThe answer is 25\u03c0 square inches.\n\nQuestion: A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 inches. What are its length and width?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by 2 * (length + width). We know that the perimeter is 36 inches, so we can set up the equation: 2 * (length + width) = 36. Solving for length and width, we get: length = 12 inches and width = 12 inches.\n\nThe answer is a length of 12 inches and a width of 12 inches.\n\nQuestion: A triangle has sides measuring 5 inches, 6 inches, and 7 inches. What is the area of the triangle?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nTo find the area of a triangle with sides measuring 5 inches, 6 inches, and 7 inches, we can use Heron's formula: s = (a + b + c) / 2, where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle. In this case, a = 5 inches, b = 6 inches, and c = 7 inches.\n\nFirst, we calculate s: s = (5 + 6 + 7) / 2 = 11.5.\n\nNext, we can calculate the area using the formula: area = \u221a(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) = \u221a(11.5 * (11.5 - 5) * (11.5 - 6) * (11.5 - 7)) = 6.25 square inches.\n\nThe answer is 6.25 square inches."]}

We know that 15% of the total number of bikes were BMX bikes, so: 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from selling each type of bike. The price of an MTB is $500, so the revenue from selling 150 MTB bikes is: 150 * $500 = $75,000.\n\nThe price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it costs $250. The revenue from selling 45 BMX bikes is: 45 * $250 = $11,250.\n\nThe revenue from selling Trekking bikes is $450 per bike, so the revenue from selling 150 Trekking bikes is: 150 * $450 = $67,500.\n\nFinally, we can find the total revenue from selling bicycles during that month by adding the revenue from selling each type of bike: $75,000 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $154,250.

{"samples": ["A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so there are 6 / 5 = 1.2 * number of total jellyfish. Since we can't have a fraction of a jellyfish, we'll round up and assume there are 13 large jellyfish. A third of these change color, so there are 13 * 1 / 3 = 4 large, blue jellyfish. The other jellyfish are small and always blue. Since there are 6 jellyfish that change color under UV light, and they are all large, blue jellyfish, there must be a total of 6 jellyfish in this group. However, we know that there are 13 large jellyfish, so there must be 13 - 6 = 7 large, non-blue jellyfish. The total number of jellyfish in the tank is the sum of large and small jellyfish: 7 + 6 = 13.\n\nAlternatively, we could have calculated the number of small jellyfish by subtracting the number of large jellyfish from the total number of jellyfish: 200 - 13 = 187. Since half of the jellyfish are small, there are 187 / 2 = 93 small jellyfish. The total number of jellyfish is 13 + 93 = 106.\n\nSo, the answer is either 13 or 106, depending on the interpretation of the problem. However, it's more likely that there is a mistake in the problem statement, as it's unlikely that there would be only 6 jellyfish that change color under UV light out of a large number of jellyfish."]}

If the total cost of the trip is $1800, how many more people are there in the group?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the trip is $1800 and each person pays $150, so there are 1800 / 150 = 12 people in the group. However, the question states that there are 12 people planning the trip, but the actual number of people in the group is different. Let x be the number of additional people. The total cost of the trip for 12 people is 12 * $150 = $1800, and the total cost of the trip for 12 + x people is (12 + x) * $150. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and solving for x, we get x = 1800 / $150 - 12 = 6. The answer is 6.\n\nQuestion: A car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

So, they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day.\n\nOn the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, so they used 88 - 10 = 78 bandages. They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and only used half a pack, so they used 50 and had 50 left over. The total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day was 78 + 50 = 128.\n\nSince the difference between the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day and the number of bandages they had at the end of the first day is the number of bandages they used during those two days, we can find the number of bandages they used by subtracting the number of bandages they had at the end of the first day from the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day: 128 - 88 = 40 bandages.\n\nTherefore, the nurses used 40 bandages during the second and third days.

{"samples": ["First, let's find out how much water each type of plant needs:\n- 4 plants need half a cup of water, so 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.\n- 8 plants need 1 cup of water, so 8 * 1 = 8 cups.\n- The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup, so we need to find out how many plants that is and then add up their water needs. Let's call the number of these plants x. Then x * 0.25 = x / 4 = cups for these plants.\n\nNow we can add up the water needs for all the plants:\n2 cups + 8 cups + x cups = 10 + x cups.\n\nSo Crista needs 10 + x cups of water every day for her plants. We don't know the value of x, but we can find it if we know how many plants have a quarter of a cup water need. Once we have that information, we can add it to the number of plants that need half a cup and the number of plants that need 1 cup to find the total number of plants, and then divide by the number of plants per flat to find the number of flats. Since each flat holds 8 plants, we can then find the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup by subtracting the number of plants that need half a cup and the number of plants that need 1 cup from the total number of plants, and then dividing by 4 to find how many of those plants are in one flat, and then multiplying by 0.25 to find how many of them need a quarter of a cup.\n\nFor example, if there are 12 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water, then there are 48 - 8 - 2 = 38 plants in total, and there are 4 flats with 8 plants each, so there are 38 / (8 / flat) = 5.25 flats, which means there are 5 flats and 2 extra plants. So Crista needs 10 + 0.25 * 2 = 10.5 cups of water every day for her plants.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a flat, Crista would need to round up and buy 6 flats to ensure she has enough water for all her plants. So she would need 6 * 8 = 48 cups of water every day for her plants. The answer is 48."]}

{"samples": ["1. First, let's find out how many holes Nate's dog digs in total during the 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, so during the vacation, the dog digs 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n2. Next, let's find out how many holes Nate fills in each day. He fills in 9 holes a day, so the number of days it takes him to fill in all the holes is 84 holes / 9 holes/day = 9.33 days. Since he can't have a fraction of a day, he needs to work for an additional day to fill in all the holes.\n3. Therefore, it takes Nate 9 days to fill in all the holes during the day, but since the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, it will take him an additional week (7 days) to fill in all the holes.\n4. The answer is 9 days (during the day) + 1 week (7 days) = 10 weeks.\n\nSo, it takes Nate a total of 10 weeks to fill in all the holes."]}

Solving for Aaron's mile time, we get: Aaron's mile time = 4 miles / (2 * 16 minutes) = 1 mile / 8 minutes.\n\nNow, we can find out how long it took Vanessa to run one mile: Since Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did, and Aaron ran one mile in 8 minutes, we can set up the equation: Vanessa's mile time * 2 miles = 1 mile / 8 minutes. Solving for Vanessa's mile time, we get: Vanessa's mile time = 1 mile / (2 * 8 minutes) = 1 mile / 16 minutes.\n\nFinally, we can find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles: Vanessa's time for 4 miles = 4 miles * 1 mile / 16 minutes = 2 * 1 mile / 4 minutes = 1/2 mile / 1 minute = 30 seconds.\n\nSo, Vanessa took 30 seconds to complete her part of the race.
