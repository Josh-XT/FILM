{"samples": [" D: farming areas. James was looking for a good place to buy farmland, so it would make sense for him to look for farming areas where he can find fertile land suitable for agricultural production. While the Midwest and Illinois are known for their farming industries, and the countryside and estate may have farmland, the most direct answer would be farming areas."]}
{"samples": [" C: Great Britain. Ferrets are popular pets in Great Britain."]}

Wallpaper is also a common material for interior design, but it is not typically made of vinyl either."]}
{"samples": [" D: make peace.\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks for an action that can lead to harmony with the world. Making peace is the most appropriate answer as it implies creating a state of friendship, agreement, or concord between oneself and the world. This can be achieved through acts of kindness, understanding, and respect towards all living beings and the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, taking time (option A) can be seen as a means to an end, rather than an action itself. Making noise (option B) and making war (option C) are actions that can disrupt harmony and create conflict. Making haste (option E) means acting quickly, which can sometimes lead to hasty decisions that may not be in harmony with the world.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: make peace."]}
{"samples": [" A: farm house. A heifer is a young cow that has not yet given birth to a calf. The master or owner of the heifer typically lives in a farm house on the farm where the heifer is raised."]}

{"samples": [" C: floor, D: carpet.\n\nExplanation: The question asks what could go on top of wood. The options provided are not all valid answers. A lumberyard, a synagogue, and a hardware store are not things that can go on top of wood. They are places where you might find wood or buy wood-related products.

{"samples": [" D: apartment. A toilet in an apartment is typically only accessible to the residents and their guests, making it a place where friends could potentially use it. The other options do not necessarily limit access to only friends."]}
{"samples": [" C: dull or E: stupid. These words are often used to describe someone who isn't clever, bright, or competent. However, it's important to note that intelligence and competence can take many forms and that everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses.

Instead, we should strive to understand and appreciate the complexities of each individual."]}

Both \"bring forward\" and \"advance\" mean to move something earlier in time. Therefore, either answer is correct.\n\nThe other options are not related to finishing work on time when one is prone to postpone it.\n\nA: Eat - Eating does not help finish work on time when one is prone to postpone it.\nB: Hasten - Hastening means to make something happen more quickly, but it does not address the root cause of not finishing work on time when one is prone to postpone it.\nC: Antedate - Antedating means to do something before its due date, but it does not necessarily mean bringing forward the entire project or task. It only means doing a specific part of it earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: bring forward or E: advance."]}
{"samples": [" C: county engineer's office. Old underground maps from the 50s are more likely to be found in the records of government agencies responsible for infrastructure planning and development, such as the county engineer's office. Libraries may have historical maps, but they are less likely to have detailed underground maps from that era. Subway stations and supermarkets are not the usual places to find such maps. James's home is also an unlikely source, as most people do not keep old underground maps at home unless they have a specific reason to do so."]}

{"samples": [" B: refrigerator. Leftover cake should be stored in the refrigerator to keep it fresh for a longer period of time."]}

A whirlpool bath is a larger body of water designed for bathing, while a puddle is a small collection of water. The other options, such as a coffee cup or a cup, are not large enough for a human to submerge himself in. A soft drink is a beverage and not a container of water."]}

{"samples": [": A) fish market or C) fishmongers.\n\nExplanation: Crabs are aquatic animals that are often sold in fish markets and by fishmongers. Therefore, they are likely to be excited or enthusiastic about crabs because they handle and sell them regularly. The other options do not make sense in this context. The intertidal zone is a natural environment where crabs live, but it is not a group of people or businesses. Obesity is a health condition, not an entity that can be excited about a crab."]}
{"samples": [" C: dress shop. In a dress shop, a human can find a variety of clothing items, including dresses, blouses, skirts, and other top pieces. Pants are typically sold in pants shops or department stores. A train wreck is an unexpected and often damaging event, and while it's possible to find clothes there, they are unlikely to be in good condition or of the desired type. Planet Earth is a large object that supports life, but it doesn't have clothing stores. Schools primarily provide education and may have uniforms or clothing drives, but they don't sell clothes to the general public."]}
{"samples": [" E: pass out. When someone is getting drunk, they may have difficulty speaking clearly due to impaired motor functions and coordination, which is commonly referred to as slurred speech. However, the question specifically asks for an answer that might make it difficult for others to understand what the person is saying, and passing out (losing consciousness) would make it impossible for anyone to understand them at all. The other options (seizure, death, forgetfulness) are not related to the ability to communicate clearly."]}
{"samples": [" D: momentum. When a person is beginning work, they are typically trying to build up momentum and get into a productive flow. This can help them accomplish more as they continue working. The other options, such as time, tiredness, and working, are not exactly what is being built in this context.

Learning lessons from the situation is a possible outcome, but it is not the primary action described in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is D: get tired of."]}
{"samples": [" E: classroom. A movie theatre, bowling alley, and factory are not typically places where tests are given. A classroom is the correct answer as it is the typical setting for taking a test."]}
{"samples": [" B: countryside. The freeway described in the question has no traffic and few buildings, which is a characteristic of rural or countryside areas."]}
{"samples": [" D: friend's house or E: fairgrounds as both options suggest going out and having fun with a few people. Watching television (A) and being good (B) are not specific locations for social activities. The cinema (C) is a place to go out and have fun with others, but it is more of a singular activity as opposed to a social gathering. Therefore, the best answer would be D: friend's house or E: fairgrounds."]}
{"samples": [" C: sandy. A hot and arid place is typically described as being sandy, as this type of environment is often associated with deserts, which are known for their lack of water and extreme heat. The other options do not accurately describe a hot and arid place. B: lifeless is not necessarily true, as many hot and arid places are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species. A: bland is not an accurate description, as hot and arid environments can be visually striking and full of color. D: neutral is not a term commonly used to describe hot and arid environments. E: freezing is the opposite of hot and arid, as freezing environments are characterized by low temperatures and a lack of water in a different way."]}
{"samples": [" A, hear news. Satisfying someone's curiosity often involves gaining new knowledge or information. Hearing news can provide up-to-date information on various topics, which can help satisfy someone's curiosity. However, it's important to note that different people may have different preferences and what satisfies one person's curiosity may not be the same for another. So, reading a book (B), seeing a favorite show (C), watching a comedy show (D), or going somewhere (E) can also be effective ways to satisfy someone's curiosity depending on their individual interests and preferences."]}
{"samples": [" B: Michigan. The question states that you are in a bar in a glove-shaped state. Michigan is the only state in the United States that is shaped like a glove."]}

{"samples": [" A: maritime or B: bodies of water. Crabs are aquatic animals that live in various types of bodies of water, including the sea, oceans, and even freshwater. They are adapted to live in maritime environments, which is why options A and B are the correct answers.\n\nOption C, saltwater, is also correct because most crabs live in saltwater environments. However, it is not a complete answer as it does not specify the type of environment crabs live in.\n\nOption D, Galapagos, is not a complete answer as it refers to a specific location where certain types of crabs can be found, but it does not describe the type of environment crabs live in in general.\n\nOption E, fish market, is not the correct answer as it describes a location where crabs may be found, but it does not describe the type of environment crabs live in."]}
{"samples": [" D: field. Snakes are commonly found in fields or grassy areas. They blend well with the tall grass, making it difficult to spot them. The other options, A: tree, B: in a jar, C: pet shops, and E: tropical forest, are not the correct answers for the given question."]}
{"samples": [" A: state park. A state park is a common place where you can find a bench nestled in trees, often near picnic areas or scenic viewpoints."]}
{"samples": [" C: have lunch or D: cook dinner. A human is likely to go or do something to satisfy their hunger. They could have lunch if it's an appropriate mealtime, or they could cook dinner if they are at home and have the ingredients and time to prepare a meal. Eating in a restaurant (A) is an option, but it's not the most likely answer given the question. Making bread (B) is not directly related to satisfying hunger, as it's a process of preparing an ingredient rather than consuming it."]}
{"samples": [" not among the given options. The text suggests that the speaker had second thoughts about the fight when he saw his opponent, but it does not provide any information about the opponent's emotions or qualities. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the opponent was fun, joyful, satisfying, confident, or proud based on the given information."]}

{"samples": [" E: school. The context of the question suggests that Sally is likely working in a school environment, given that she is reading off names at the beginning of the day.

The given options suggest various activities that kids might do, such as learning things (A), playing games (B), going to Disneyland (C), or playing with toys (D). The option \"talking\" (E) is not a likely answer because talking is not typically associated with not cleaning up after an activity.\n\nTherefore, based on the context of the question and the given options, the most likely answers are B: play games or D: play with toys."]}
{"samples": [" A: a chess game.\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks for the context in which a pawn can be versatile and all its parts are important. The best answer is a chess game because in the game of chess, pawns have various roles and functions that contribute to the overall strategy and outcome of the game. They can be moved forward to capture enemy pieces, be promoted to more powerful pieces when they reach the opposite end of the board, and be used to create tactical opportunities. Therefore, a chess game is the correct answer."]}
{"samples": [" C: full of air. If a basketball has a hole in it but it does not lose its general shape, it means that the air inside the basketball is escaping, so it would not be full of air."]}

{"samples": [" D: have a guilty conscience. Committing murder could prevent someone from having a guilty conscience if they do not feel remorse for their actions.

A resort is a common type of place where people go to relax and stay in hotels.

A bed away from home could refer to any type of lodging, but the question specifies a hotel. A wwii bunker is a fortified structure used as a shelter during war, not a place to stay in a hotel.

A synagogue is a place of worship for Jews, and it is not necessarily a place where a person could avoid the rain. A fairy tale is a story, often with magical elements, and it is not a physical location where a person could seek shelter from the rain. A street corner is an intersection of two streets, and it does not provide any shelter from the rain."]}

Increased workload and being employed are not typically feelings experienced during the job application process."]}
{"samples": [" E: committing perjury.\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks about a person who was on trial for obstructing justice and was also found guilty of something else. The answer choices do not fit this description, but option E is the most likely answer to the question based on the context.

This description fits best with a closed room. The other options do not match the given information. Sky (B) is not a confined space, Dard (C) is not a place where someone can be, and his grave (D) is not a place where someone can be with a light bulb.

{"samples": [": A: satisfaction or D: feel good about yourself. Both options fit the context of the question as Jenny is described as enjoying helping people, which implies a positive emotional response. However, the question specifically asks for a term that brings Jenny a great deal of it, making options A and D the best answers. Satisfaction is a common term used to describe the feeling of having met one's needs or desires, while feeling good about oneself is a related concept of self-esteem and confidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is either A: satisfaction or D: feel good about yourself.\n\nThe other options, B: complications and C: train, do not fit the context of the question as they do not describe a positive emotional response that Jenny experiences from helping people."]}
{"samples": [" B: sanitation. When someone is cleaning clothes, they are typically focusing on making the clothes clean and free from dirt or bacteria.
