{"samples": [" The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. To find the number of popsicles each of them has, we can set up a proportion:\n\n5/6 = x/165\n\nwhere x is the number of popsicles Sam has.\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n5 * 165 = 6 * x\n\n825 = 6x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 6 to isolate x:\n\nx = 825 / 6\n\nx = 137.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a popsicle, we can round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 138\n\nSam has 138 popsicles.\n\nNow, we can find the number of popsicles Betty has by subtracting Sam's popsicles from the total:\n\n165 - 138 = 27\n\nBetty has 27 popsicles.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference between Sam's and Betty's popsicles:\n\n138 - 27 = 111\n\nSam has 111 more popsicles than Betty.

To find out how many roses Ford needs to grow every week to supply all the flower shops, we add the orders of all three flower shops: 20 roses + 15 roses + 30 roses = 65 roses.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many roses Ford needs to grow every month. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, Ford needs to grow 65 roses * 4 weeks = 260 roses every month to supply all the flower shops.\n\nSince Ford grows 40 roses every week, he needs to grow 260 roses / 4 weeks = 65 roses per week to meet the demand of all the flower shops.\n\nFord grows 40 roses every week, so he lacks 65 roses - 40 roses = 25 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

So, we can write another equation:\n\nT + T1 + T2 + T3 = 44\n\nwhere T2 and T3 are the ages of the other twin and triplet, respectively.\n\nSince there are two sets of twins and triplets, we can assume that the other twin and triplet have the same ages as the first set. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2T + 2T1 + 2T2 + 2T3 = 44\n\nNow, we can substitute T1 from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n2T + 2(T - 7) + 2T2 + 2T3 = 44\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2T + 2T - 14 + 2T2 + 2T3 = 44\n\n4T - 14 + 2T2 + 2T3 = 44\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n6T + 2T2 + 2T3 = 30\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the combined ages are 44 to find the value of T2 and T3:\n\nT + T1 + T2 + T3 = 44\nT + T1 + (T - 7) + (T - 7) = 44\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2T + 2T1 = 36\n\nNow, we can substitute T1 from the first equation into the simplified equation:\n\n2T + 2(T - 7) = 36\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2T + 2T - 14 = 36\n\n4T - 14 = 36\n\nAdding 14 to both sides, we get:\n\n4T = 50\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nT = 12.5\n\nSince the ages must be whole numbers, this is not possible.

Since she is 2\" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert, we can set up the equation: Jackie's height = Anne's height - 2.\n\nAnne's height = 2 * Albert's height = 2 * 36 = 72 inches.\n\nSince Jackie is now 3\" taller than before, we can set up another equation: Jackie's height = Jackie's height before summer + 3.\n\nCombining the two equations, we get: Jackie's height before summer = 72 - 2 - 3 = 67 inches.\n\nThe answer is 67."]}

{"samples": [" First, let's calculate the cost of the two T-shirts. Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8. The second T-shirt is free because of the deal. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discounted price, we multiply the original price by the percentage off: $40 x 0.40 = $16. So, the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.\n\nNow, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32.

{"samples": [" First, let's find out how many holes Nate's dog digs in total during the 14 days of vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, so in 14 days, the dog digs 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n\nNow, let's find out how many holes Nate fills in each day. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, so he fills in 9 holes/day * 7 days = 63 holes in a week.\n\nSince the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to account for these new holes. In a week, the dog digs 6 holes/night * 7 nights = 42 holes.\n\nNow, let's find out how many holes are left unfilled after a week. Nate fills in 63 holes, but the dog digs 42 new holes, so there are 63 holes filled - 42 holes dug = 21 holes left unfilled.\n\nSince Nate fills in 21 holes in the first week, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take him to fill in the remaining holes. There are 84 holes - 21 holes filled = 63 holes left to fill.\n\nNate fills in 63 holes in a week, so it will take him 63 holes / 63 holes per week = 1 week to fill in the remaining holes.\n\nSo, it will take Nate 1 week to fill in all the holes.
