The Garden occupied part of the grounds of the Lorillard estate and a parcel that was formerly the easternmost portion of the campus of St. John's College. The stated purpose of the act was to establish and maintain a botanical garden and museum and arboretum, to advance botanical science and knowledge, and to prosecute original researches in kindred subjects. The legislation provided 250 acres within Bronx Park to the NYBG and enabled the board of directors to construct a library and conservatory if at least $250,000 was raised within five years. The first structures to open at the NYBG were the LuEsther T. Mertz Library and the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, which were built between 1897 and 1900 and completed in 1902, respectively. Therefore, the first scientific journal published by an organization located in the Bronx was likely published by the New York Botanical Garden around this time."]}

{"samples": [" Hans Albert Einstein was educated at ETH Zurich, where he studied civil engineering, graduating in 1926. From 1926 to 1930, he worked at the steel design company Kl\u00f6nne, in Dortmund, Germany. From 1931 to 1938, he worked as a research engineer at the newly founded Laboratory of Hydraulics and Soil Mechanics (VAWE) at ETH Zurich. There, in 1936 Hans Albert obtained a doctorate in technical science. His doctoral thesis \"Bed Load Transport as a Probability Problem\" (Der Geschiebetrieb als Wahrscheinlichkeitsproblem) is considered the definitive work on sediment transport. Hans emigrated from Switzerland to Greenville, South Carolina, in 1938, and worked for the US Department of Agriculture, studying sediment transport from 1938 to 1943. He continued working for the USDA at the California Institute of Technology starting in 1943. In 1947 he took a position as associate professor of hydraulic engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He advanced to full professor, and later professor emeritus. Einstein traveled the world to participate in hydraulic engineering conferences. He was at a symposium at Woods Hole in Massachusetts when he collapsed and died from heart failure on July 26, 1973."]}
