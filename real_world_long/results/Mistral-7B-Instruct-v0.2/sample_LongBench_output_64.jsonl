{"samples": [" The proximity of superconductivity tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature.

The non-local pairing induced by superconducting proximity effect can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening, and relatively small values of coupling to superconductivity are sufficient for the effect to occur."]}

However, their use in modeling visual cortex is limited by the immaturity of training algorithms. Recent advancements in directly trained deep SNNs make it possible to use them as visual cortex models."]}

{"samples": [" The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by influencing the amount of energy required for the bubble to compress its size. In the shock compression stage, bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress, resulting in smaller translational energy and slower average motion. However, once the shock wave passes through the bubble, a larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubbles due to their smaller size and increased translational energy."]}

{"samples": [" The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for unstandardized CPUE and standardized CPUE. For unstandardized CPUE, there is a positive relationship between catch per set and number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when standardizing CPUE for the number of hooks, the relationships are reversed, with standardized CPUE of bottom longlines significantly higher than that of surface longlines. Additionally, vessels with moderate engine horsepower have the highest standardized CPUE. These findings suggest that although increasing fishing effort increases total catch for these gears and trips, there are diminishing returns of this increased effort above low to moderate levels."]}
