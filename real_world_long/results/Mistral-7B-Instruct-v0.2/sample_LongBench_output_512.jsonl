{"samples": ["\nThis report provides background information and issues for Congress regarding multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), two special contracting mechanisms used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for select defense acquisition programs. MYP and BBC have the potential to reduce weapon procurement costs by a few to several percent compared to the standard annual contracting approach. However, there are issues for Congress concerning the future use of these contracting mechanisms, including whether to use them more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used, and whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC.\n\nMYP and BBC differ from annual contracting in that they allow DOD to use a single contract for multiple years, reducing the need for contract options and potential cost savings through economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases. MYP has a permanent statute (10 U.S.C. 2306b) governing its use, while BBC does not.\n\nMYP has been used for a limited number of DOD programs, with three Navy shipbuilding programs using BBC as their contracting approach. The Navy has made extensive use of MYP and BBC in its ship and aircraft acquisition programs, reducing costs by billions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security but a military service, could also benefit from using MYP and BBC in its ship acquisition programs, particularly the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program and the polar icebreaker program.\n\nThe report discusses the potential savings from using MYP and BBC, the differences between MYP and BBC, and the risks and benefits of using these contracting mechanisms. It also addresses the issue of terminology confusion between MYP and BBC and the difference between contracting mechanisms and funding approaches.\n\nCongress's decisions on the future use of MYP and BBC could impact defense acquisition practices, defense funding requirements, and the defense industrial base."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report provides an analysis of the sustainment of selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, totaling 2,823 aircraft and requiring approximately $20 billion to operate and support in fiscal year 2016. The report highlights the importance of DOD policy, which requires services to develop and implement a sustainment strategy for their weapon systems, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan. The report also outlines the roles and responsibilities of various DOD offices in sustaining fixed-wing aircraft, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness.\n\nThe report finds that between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, six of 12 fixed-wing aircraft experienced decreased aircraft availability, one met availability goals each year, and five did not meet goals in any year. Additionally, some aircraft experienced increases in O&S costs, while others decreased. Maintenance costs were found to be one of the largest portions of total O&S costs for each aircraft, averaging about 36% for the Air Force aircraft and 42% for the Navy aircraft.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges facing the Air Force and Navy in sustaining their fixed-wing aircraft, including aging, maintenance, and supply support. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, and that the Secretary of the Navy does the same."]}
{"samples": ["\nWildlife trafficking is a global issue with an estimated value ranging from $7 billion to $23 billion annually. The United States is not exempt from this illegal activity, with various species, including live reptiles, birds, mammals, elephant ivory, and plants, being illegally traded. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are responsible for enforcing laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA have budgets and employ special agents to investigate wildlife crimes, with FWS focusing on terrestrial wildlife, freshwater species, and birds, and NOAA focusing on marine wildlife and anadromous fish.\n\nBoth agencies have policies in place for paying financial rewards to individuals who provide information leading to arrests, convictions, or forfeitures of property related to wildlife trafficking. However, the data on the number and amount of rewards paid from fiscal years 2007 to 2017 is not complete, and the agencies could not provide sufficient assurance that all rewards were accounted for.\n\nFWS and NOAA have also used financial rewards to thank sources for proactively providing information, leading to successful investigations and convictions. For example, FWS paid a reward in 2010 for information on an attempt to illegally traffic leopards into the United States from South Africa. NOAA paid a reward in 2016 for information on the illegal trafficking of sea scallops and a green sea turtle.\n\nTo improve their use of financial rewards as a law enforcement tool, FWS and NOAA should consider making more information available to the public on the potential availability of rewards and the process for submitting information. They should also review the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards and consider potential improvements, such as making standing reward offers for high-priority endangered species or particular criminal networks. By doing so, FWS and NOAA can increase their chances of obtaining valuable information on wildlife trafficking activities and bring more criminals to justice."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the importance of cross-border data flows in today's global economy, which enable international trade and commerce by facilitating online communication, supply chain tracking, research sharing, and cross-border services. Digital commerce relying on data flows is estimated to drive 22% of global economic output, and advances in emerging technologies are projected to add another $2 trillion to global GDP by 2020. However, the security and privacy of data being transmitted raise concerns.\n\nThe United States has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish international rules and best practices to promote online security and privacy while enabling international data flows. Building consensus for international rules and norms on data flows and privacy has become increasingly important due to recent incidents, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and data breaches, which have heightened public awareness of the risks of personal data stored online.\n\nThe report highlights the value of personal data, which can be used for various reasons, including facilitating business transactions, analyzing marketing information, and detecting fraudulent payments. However, personal data is also considered a liability due to the risk of privacy breaches and the need for organizations to protect users' privacy and not misuse the information.\n\nThe report notes that countries vary in their privacy policies and laws, with the United States traditionally supporting open data flows and regulating privacy at a sectoral level. Other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade by limiting data flows outside of an organization or across national borders. Blocking international data flows can impede business operations and create trade protectionism, while research demonstrates the economic gains from digital trade and international data flows and the real costs of restrictions on such flows.\n\nThe report also discusses the role of Congress in addressing online privacy and cross-border data flows, including its examination of multiple issues related to these topics and its consideration of the proposed USMCA and other trade agreements. The report concludes by emphasizing the need for governments to protect individual privacy in the least trade-restrictive way possible and the importance of finding a global consensus on how to balance open data flows and privacy protection to maintain trust in the digital environment and advance international trade."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe federal government supports airport infrastructure development through various means, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), passenger facility charges (PFCs), and tax-exempt bonds. AIP provides grants for airport development and planning, primarily for capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. PFCs allow airports to raise revenue for a broader range of projects, including landside improvements. Tax-exempt bonds offer investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements.\n\nAirport infrastructure development began during World War II, with the first major federal support for airport construction. The Federal Airport Act of 1946 established the Federal Aid to Airports Program, which continued federal aid at lower levels than during the war years. In the 1960s, substantial funding was used to upgrade and extend runways for commercial jets. In 1970, Congress passed the Airport and Airway Development Act and the Airport and Airway Revenue Act, which established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and the current AIP.\n\nAIP provides grants to airports for capital projects without the financial burden of debt financing, but recipients must adhere to all program regulations and grant assurances. The trust fund is the primary source of funds for most FAA activities, including airport and airway facilities and equipment, research, engineering, and development, and FAA operations and maintenance.\n\nSince 1970, airport infrastructure needs have led to various legislative changes, including the Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, which authorized significant spending increases for AIP, and the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990, which allowed airports to impose PFCs.\n\nIn recent years, airport infrastructure needs have continued to grow, leading to debates over the appropriate level of federal support and the distribution of funding among different types of airports. Some proposals include altering AIP grant assurances, raising or eliminating the PFC ceiling, and expanding the definition of governmental airport bonds.\n\nOverall, the federal role in airport infrastructure development has evolved significantly since World War II, with various programs and funding sources designed to support the development and improvement of airport facilities."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe given context discusses the process of funding and managing military construction (MILCON) projects through the Department of Defense (DOD). MILCON appropriations are used to construct temporary or permanent facilities for U.S. military forces in the United States and overseas. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes and appropriates funds for MILCON projects each year, with specific congressional direction on funding levels for individual projects. DOD uses Form 1391 to submit project requirements and justifications for funding requests to Congress.\n\nMILCON appropriations are generally available for obligation for 5 fiscal years, after which they expire and are no longer available for any purposes. However, funds can be reprogrammed to other MILCON projects if needed. DOD has flexibility to reprogram funds without congressional approval for below-threshold reprogrammings, but above-threshold reprogrammings require prior approval.\n\nThe context also highlights the importance of reliable cost estimates for MILCON projects and the need for DOD to improve its cost estimating guidance (i.e., the Unified Facilities Criteria) by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates. The report provides examples of cost overruns and underestimates in MILCON projects and recommends that the Secretary of Defense ensure that DOD's cost estimating guidance is improved.\n\nThe report also discusses the execution of MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016, with a focus on the obligations made by each military department for congressionally directed and other MILCON projects. The report found that the Army, Air Force, and Navy consistently expended over 90% of their appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2011, with unexpended rates varying for amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2014 through 2016.\n\nIn summary, the context discusses the process of funding and managing military construction projects through the Department of Defense, the importance of reliable cost estimates, and the need for DOD to improve its cost estimating guidance. The report provides examples of cost overruns and underestimates in MILCON projects and recommends improvements to DOD's cost estimating processes."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report outlines the role of the Federal Student Aid (FSA) office in ensuring postsecondary schools meet eligibility requirements to participate in federal student aid programs. Schools must be certified by Education, accredited, and authorized by the state. FSA is responsible for ensuring schools are eligible and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools undergo annual compliance audits, and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) assesses the quality of these audits.\n\nFSA uses provisional certification for initial applicants and schools that do not fully comply with federal student aid requirements. Provisional certification lasts 1 to 3 years, and schools are subject to more FSA oversight. Schools cannot open new campus locations or offer new programs without approval during this period.\n\nFSA regional staff review various sources of information during the certification process, including school documents, proof of accreditation, state authorization, audited financial statements, self-reported school data, and compliance audits. FSA conducts program reviews to evaluate school compliance with federal requirements and provides guidance to schools to help them meet certification requirements.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, FSA approved most schools for initial certification, with denial rates for public, for-profit, and nonprofit schools being 11%, 11%, and 14%, respectively. For recertification, 76% of schools were fully recertified, 21% were provisionally recertified, and 3% were denied.\n\nThe report highlights concerns about the quality of compliance audits, with the OIG identifying deficiencies in 59% of the audits reviewed. FSA and OIG are taking steps to address these issues, including providing additional training for auditors and issuing revised audit guides. These efforts aim to improve the quality of compliance audits and provide accurate and reliable information for Education's recertification decisions."]}

In fiscal year 2017, agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), involving various threat vectors such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and loss or theft of computer equipment. The report provides examples of significant cybersecurity incidents, including the Iranian cybertheft campaign and Russian government actors targeting U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe federal approach to securing information systems is outlined in the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, and Executive Order 13800. FISMA sets requirements for effectively securing federal systems and information, while the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act requires protecting federal networks through federal intrusion prevention and detection capabilities. Executive Order 13800 directs agencies to manage cybersecurity risks to the federal enterprise using the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\n\nThe report also discusses the progress made by federal agencies in implementing the government's approach and strategy to securing information systems. While some agencies have made significant strides, others have reported significant deficiencies in their information security programs. The report recommends several actions for the Secretary of DHS, the Director of OMB, and other agencies to improve the implementation of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and address obstacles and impediments affecting their abilities to do so."]}

The ESF is used for project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. USAID implements most ESF programs, including those related to private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. The assistance aims to build a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society.\n\nAs of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million and expended about $350.6 million of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Payments to PA creditors accounted for about 28 percent of fiscal year 2016 obligations and 26 percent of fiscal year 2015 obligations. These payments included debts for petroleum purchases to Israeli fuel companies and a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network.\n\nUSAID's ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 was obligated for three development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure, Investing in the Next Generation, and Governance and Civic Engagement. The largest share, about 60 percent, supported the Economic Growth and Infrastructure objective, with projects in health, infrastructure, private sector competitiveness, and stabilization operations and security sector reform. The second-largest share, about 27 percent, supported the Investing in the Next Generation objective, with projects in education, health, social and economic services, and protection of vulnerable populations. The smallest share, about 6 percent, supported the Governance and Civic Engagement objective, with projects in civil society, good governance, and rule of law.\n\nUSAID's policies and procedures, outlined in Mission Order 21, ensure that assistance does not inadvertently provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism.

{"samples": ["\nThe report focuses on the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), a program enacted during the 111th Congress to enhance small business access to capital and address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis. The SBLF provided the Secretary of the Treasury with temporary authority to make capital investments in eligible institutions to increase the availability of credit for small businesses. Eligible financial institutions with total assets of $1 billion or less could apply for a capital investment of up to 5% of risk-weighted assets, while those with assets between $1 billion and $10 billion could apply for up to 3%. The program was limited to one year after enactment, and participating banks were charged a dividend rate of no more than 5% per annum initially, with reduced rates available for increased small business lending.\n\nThe SBLF was designed to encourage lenders, particularly those experiencing liquidity problems, to increase their lending to small businesses, creating jobs and assisting in the economic recovery. However, opponents argued that the program could lose money, lack sufficient oversight provisions, and serve as a vehicle for TARP recipients to refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms. Some also questioned the use of quarterly call report data to measure small business lending and the validity of reported lending gains.\n\nDespite these concerns, the SBLF has reportedly led to increased small business lending, with 332 lending institutions receiving over $4.0 billion in financing as of December 31, 2018. Of these institutions, 137 had previously participated in TARP programs. The SBLF is currently undergoing oversight, with the Treasury Department required to publish monthly, semiannual, and quarterly reports on the program's transactions, costs, and participating institutions.\n\nThe report also discusses several bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF, such as S. 681, which would have required recipients to repay SBLF distributions within 10 years and terminated the program no later than 15 years after enactment.

The Navy aims to achieve a fleet of 355 ships by FY2034, but the mix of ships may change due to a new Force Structure Assessment currently underway. The assessment could shift the Navy's surface force to a more distributed architecture, with a reduced proportion of large surface combatants and an increased proportion of small surface combatants and unmanned surface vehicles. The new FSA might also change the Navy's undersea force to include a new element of extremely large unmanned underwater vehicles.\n\nThe Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy's FY2020-FY2049 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 304 new ships, which is projected to result in a fleet of 355 ships by FY2034. However, the actual mix of ships in the fleet may not match the composition called for in the 2016 FSA.\n\nThe report also discusses the affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan, which has been a matter of oversight focus for several years. The plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, as well as replacements for large numbers of retiring attack submarines, cruisers, and destroyers.

{"samples": ["\nThe Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program provides loans to small businesses for working capital and other general business purposes, with SBA guaranteeing a portion of the loan made by commercial lenders. SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to approve and service 7(a) loans and ensure borrower eligibility. To be eligible, businesses must be operating, for-profit, and located in the US, meet the credit elsewhere requirement, and meet SBA size standards. The credit elsewhere requirement means that borrowers must demonstrate that they cannot obtain credit from non-federal sources on reasonable terms.\n\nSBA has faced challenges in overseeing lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement due to a lack of guidance on how to document compliance. In response, SBA revised its standard operating procedure to require that each loan file contain documentation specifically identifying the factors that meet the credit elsewhere test. SBA's current credit elsewhere criteria include factors such as longer maturity, loan amount limits, collateral requirements, and industry or business type.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2007 to 2016, a majority of loan dollars went to small businesses that were new, partially or wholly owned by women, or located in distressed areas. Recent studies suggest that certain small business borrowers, including those that are new or owned by women, have difficulty obtaining conventional small business loans, which may put them at a disadvantage.\n\nSBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement through on-site and targeted reviews. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 40 on-site reviews identified compliance issues with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, and 7 of 24 targeted reviews found a compliance issue. The key factors underlying lenders' high rate of noncompliance were lack of proper internal controls and procedures and lack of awareness of the credit elsewhere documentation requirement.\n\nTo improve lender compliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement and ensure that 7(a) loans are reaching their intended population, SBA should require reviewers to consistently document their assessments of a lender's policies and practices, collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria as part of its monitoring, and analyze this information to identify lenders that may be at greater risk of noncompliance."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) aimed to shift the focus of federal agencies from program activities and processes to results. The act required agencies to develop long-term and annual goals and measure progress towards those goals. By 2004, GPRA had laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management, with performance planning and measurement becoming a part of agencies' cultures. However, the full benefits of collecting performance information were not being realized as managers' use of that information for decision making had not changed significantly.\n\nIn response, a framework was developed in 2005 to help agencies better incorporate performance information into their decision making. The framework identified five leading practices and four ways agency managers could use performance information to make program decisions aimed at improving results. Examples were given of how agencies had used performance information to achieve significant improvements, such as the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration increasing national safety belt usage from 11% in 1985 to 80% in 2004.\n\nHowever, a 2010 survey showed little change in managers' use of performance information since 2007. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) was enacted to address this issue, requiring agencies to designate priority goals and measure progress towards them at least quarterly. Data-driven reviews have been found to have positive effects on progress towards agency goals and improving the efficiency of operations.\n\nDespite these efforts, reported government-wide uses of performance information have not changed significantly since 2013. Some agencies have taken actions to improve their use of performance information, such as the National Science Foundation increasing its use by 27 percentage points from 2013 to 2017. However, challenges remain, particularly at lower levels within federal agencies where mid-level and senior managers make decisions about managing programs and operations. OMB and the Performance Improvement Council have identified promising practices and challenges that could be used to inform efforts to enhance the use of performance information more extensively within agencies.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also encourages agencies to improve real property efficiency and reduce holdings through initiatives like the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and the Reduce the Footprint policy. These policies suggest using telework, along with other space efficiency strategies, to reduce the need for office space. Agencies can use telework in combination with desk-sharing, hoteling, and smaller workstations to achieve space reductions and cost savings. The General Services Administration (GSA) defines mobility as an overarching term that includes telework, desk-sharing, site work, and travel. GSA provides guidance to client agencies on implementing alternative workplace arrangements, including telework.

The process serves several purposes, including examining nominees' qualifications, influencing policy, and facilitating quick action on thousands of government positions. The Senate considers approximately 65,000 military appointments and promotions and 2,000 civilian nominations each Congress. Civilian nominations include federal judges, executive department officials, and regulatory board and commission members.\n\nThe Senate refers most nominations to committees for consideration, with the Committee on Armed Services handling the most due to military appointments and promotions. Committees may request additional information from nominees and hold hearings to scrutinize their qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Some nominations, particularly for high-level positions and judgeships, receive greater scrutiny than others.\n\nThe Senate has expressed concerns over the confirmation process in recent years, including the rate of confirmations and the speed of Senate action on routine nominations. In response, the Senate has made several changes since 2011, including reducing the number of hours required for post-cloture consideration of most nominations from 30 to 2 hours.\n\nThe confirmation process allows Senators to influence policy and extract promises from nominees before granting consent. In some cases, the Senate has delayed the process to increase its influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters. The Senate may approve en bloc hundreds of nominations at a time, especially military appointments and promotions, while closely scrutinizing a few hundred nominees to high-level positions each year.\n\nThe process includes several steps, including the President sending nomination messages to the Senate, the clerk assigning numbers to the messages, and the nominations being referred to committees for consideration. Committees may request additional information from nominees and hold hearings before reporting the nomination to the full Senate for a vote. The Senate cannot vote on a nomination the same day it is reported except by unanimous consent.\n\nThe confirmation process has evolved over time, with the Senate adopting standing orders and rules to facilitate the process. The Senate handles executive business, including nominations, separately from its legislative business and considers it in executive session. The Executive Cal"]}
{"samples": ["\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal law that requires private-sector firms to provide workers' compensation coverage for their employees engaged in maritime occupations on or adjacent to navigable waters of the United States. The LHWCA, administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), ensures medical and disability benefits for injured or ill workers and survivors' benefits for families of deceased workers. In 2016, the LHWCA paid approximately $1.41 billion in benefits. Workers' compensation is mandatory in all states except Texas, where employers may opt out under certain conditions. The LHWCA covers longshore and harbor workers, including those involved in loading, unloading, repairing, or building vessels, with some exclusions for specific classes of workers. Employers can either purchase private insurance or self-insure, and the DOL is responsible for authorizing coverage. The LHWCA provides medical benefits, disability benefits, and survivors' benefits, with no deductibles, copayments, or costs paid by the injured worker. Disability benefits are adjusted based on wage inflation, and total disability benefits are equal to two-thirds of the covered worker's wage. The claims process involves an informal conference between the employer or insurance carrier and the worker to resolve disputes, followed by a formal hearing before a DOL administrative law judge if necessary. Appeals can be made to the Benefits Review Board and, ultimately, to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The LHWCA has been amended several times to extend coverage to various occupations and areas."]}

The report identifies additional resources for further context and lists CRS policy experts for consultation on specific topics. The report explains several budgetary concepts, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act.\n\nThe Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS in FY2019, a decrease of $0.29 billion from the previous year. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $48.33 billion, and the House Appropriations Committee proposed $51.44 billion. The final enacted appropriation was $49.41 billion, which was $1.69 billion more than the FY2018 level and $2.04 billion more than the Administration's request.\n\nThe report also discusses the history of DHS appropriations, including the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) and the challenges of managing appropriations for a large and complex department.

The report begins by discussing the Supreme Court's requirement that states eliminate all vestiges of de jure segregation in their public universities, including through expressly race-conscious remedies. The report then turns to voluntary affirmative action policies, which have been subjected to strict scrutiny by the courts. To rely on the diversity rationale, universities must articulate their diversity-related goals and show that their admissions policies achieve those goals as precisely as possible while treating each applicant as an individual. The report concludes by discussing the role of Title VI in ensuring equal protection in higher education, both public and private, and potential avenues for congressional action under the Act. The report also touches on the history of affirmative action in higher education, including the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v.

This program helps individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment through individualized plans and services. In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities. These services include instruction in self-advocacy, job exploration, work-based learning, counseling on education and training, and vocational evaluation. State VR agencies reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment, including serving more students and initiating new or additional services. However, challenges remain, such as identifying all potentially eligible students and coordinating services with educational agencies. Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration provides technical assistance to state VR agencies through webinars, conference calls, and presentations at conferences. State VR agencies must reserve at least 15 percent of their VR allotment for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities. As of fiscal year 2016, 21 of 56 states reported using the full amount of grant funds they reserved for pre-employment transition services. Education officials plan to complete a round of monitoring visits to all states by the end of fiscal year 2021 but have no timeframe for providing further information on allowable costs to states.

{"samples": ["\nMedicare is a federal health insurance program established in 1965, primarily for individuals aged 65 and older, and expanded to include disabled individuals. It is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and consists of four parts: A (Hospital Insurance), B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), C (Medicare Advantage), and D (Prescription Drug Coverage). Part A is funded through payroll taxes, while Part B is funded through beneficiary premiums and general revenues. Part C is funded through the HI and SMI trust funds, and Part D is funded through a combination of beneficiary premiums, federal general revenues, and state transfers.\n\nMedicare covers a range of health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, home health services, hospice care, and prescription drugs. Inpatient hospital services are covered under Part A, while physician services and prescription drugs are covered under Part B. Home health services and hospice care are covered under both Parts A and B.\n\nMedicare spending in 2019 is estimated to be approximately $772 billion, with about $749 billion spent on benefits. The largest share of benefit spending, about 28%, goes towards hospital inpatient and outpatient services. Federal Medicare spending, after deducting beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts, is projected to be about $637 billion in 2019.\n\nMedicare is a mandatory spending program and is not subject to the appropriations process. It is a high-priority issue in Congress and has significant impacts on beneficiaries, other stakeholders, and the economy. Projections indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries, leading to potential reform options.\n\nThe committees of jurisdiction for the mandatory spending portion of Medicare are the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

{"samples": ["\nThe U.S. foreign aid program, a significant component of international affairs budget, has undergone transformative changes since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Defined as any tangible or intangible item provided to a foreign country or international organization, foreign aid has been a tool of U.S. foreign policy for decades. The focus of foreign aid policy has shifted from global anti-communism to regional issues and global development, which is now considered a third pillar of U.S. national security.\n\nThe U.S. foreign aid budget has been subject to annual congressional debate, with the executive branch requesting and Congress authorizing and appropriating funds. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy does not explicitly address the status of development vis-\u00e0-vis diplomacy and defense, but it acknowledges the historic importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting U.S. national interests.\n\nThe scope of U.S. foreign aid extends beyond the traditional foreign operations and international food aid appropriations. Many U.S. departments and agencies have adopted their own assistance programs, funded outside the purview of the traditional foreign aid authorizing and appropriations committees. These nontraditional aid efforts, which grew substantial and varied in the mid-1990s, include defense-funded humanitarian and development assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, and energy and environmental programs.\n\nThe report provides an overview of the U.S. foreign aid program, addressing its objectives, costs, and organization, as well as the role of Congress and its comparison to other aid donors. The data presented are the most current, consistent, and reliable figures available, updated through FY2017. The report aims to illustrate the evolution of American foreign assistance over time.\n\nForeign aid is predicated on several rationales, including national security, commercial interests, and humanitarian concerns. The importance and emphasis of these rationales and objectives have changed over time. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, foreign aid has been viewed as a tool in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, increasing aid to partner states in counterterrorism efforts and funding substantial reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Global development has also been a key element in U.S. national security strategy in both Bush and Obama Administration policy statements.\n\nThe report highlights the significant discrepancies between data available for traditional"]}
{"samples": ["\nThe National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative is a proposed interstate compact aimed at achieving direct popular election of the President and Vice President of the United States without the need for a constitutional amendment. The electoral college system, established by the U.S. Constitution, has been in place since 1787 and provides for the indirect election of the President and Vice President. The NPV initiative seeks to bypass the requirements of Article V by having states agree to appoint electors based on the national popular vote winner.\n\nThe electoral college system has faced criticism for not providing for direct democratic election, giving less-populous states an arithmetical advantage, and allowing candidates to win the presidency with fewer popular votes than their opponents. Despite numerous attempts to reform or eliminate the college through constitutional amendments, none have met the requirements of Article V.\n\nThe NPV initiative was launched in 2006 and has gained support from 14 states and the District of Columbia, controlling a total of 189 electoral votes. The initiative requires states whose total electoral votes equal or exceed the constitutional majority of 270 to approve the plan. If all 50 states and the District of Columbia were to join, this would deliver a unanimous electoral college decision for the candidates winning a plurality of the popular vote.\n\nThe NPV initiative has faced opposition on various grounds, including concerns about its constitutionality and potential impact on the electoral college system's historical significance. Some argue that the NPV compact would violate the Compact Clause of the Constitution, which requires congressional consent for interstate compacts. Others claim it would create a majoritarian presidency that could lead to more contested election results and legal challenges.\n\nDespite these challenges, the NPV initiative continues to gain momentum, with supporters arguing that it is a necessary reform to ensure that the popular vote winner always becomes the President. The ultimate success of the initiative will depend on its ability to secure the approval of enough states to reach the 270-vote threshold."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe federal government allocated a record $96 billion for IT investments in fiscal year 2018, yet past reports have shown that many IT projects result in cost overruns, schedule slippages, and fail to deliver desired mission-related outcomes. Examples of failed projects include the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Border Initiative Network program, and the Department of Veterans Affairs' Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program.\n\nThe root causes of these failures include a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. Executive-level governance and oversight across the government has also been ineffective, particularly from CIOs. Some CIOs lacked the authority to review and approve the entire agency IT portfolio, limiting their ability to provide effective oversight.\n\nSecurity deficiencies also pose risks to federal IT systems. In fiscal year 2016, 23 civilian Chief Financial Officers Act agencies spent approximately $4 billion on IT security-related activities. However, cybersecurity work at federal agencies continues to highlight information security deficiencies. For instance, the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid did not consistently analyze privacy risks for its electronic information systems, and the Office of Personnel Management had not fully implemented recommendations to improve its overall security posture.\n\nTo address these issues, Congress and the President have enacted various reforms, including the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). FITARA aims to improve covered agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. FISMA, on the other hand, addresses the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks and promotes the use of automated security tools to monitor and diagnose the security posture of federal agencies.\n\nDespite these efforts, further implementation of previous recommendations and guidance would better position agencies to improve the management and security of federal IT. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will continue to monitor agencies' progress in implementing these recommendations."]}

The United States played a significant role in the conflict, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war and recognizing Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs as the country's three constituent peoples. Bosnia's complex political system, which includes a parliamentary republic with a high degree of decentralization and two ethnoterritorial entities, has been a source of gridlock and ethnic divisions.\n\nThe war resulted in the displacement of roughly half of Bosnia's population and the deaths of an estimated 100,000 or more people, including over 20,000 women and girls who were victims of sexual violence. Bosnia's major parties, which have dominated politics since the war, have been accused of inflaming nationalist tensions and manipulating historical memory to distract from corruption and win elections.\n\nBosnia's economy is one of Europe's poorest, with an estimated 18% unemployment rate and nearly one in five Bosnians living below the poverty line. The country's fragmented legal and administrative structure and pervasive corruption create a challenging investment climate, with FDI amounting to just 2% of Bosnia's GDP.\n\nBosnia's relations with neighboring Croatia and Serbia are important for regional stability but have often been fraught due to the legacy of the Bosnian war and sensitivities over Croatian and Serbian relations with Bosnian Croats and Serbs. Russia has been accused of exacerbating ethnic divisions and backing illiberal or anti-Western political factions in Bosnia, as well as helping to militarize Republika Srpska.\n\nDespite these challenges, many analysts contend that the Dayton Agreement has helped hold Bosnia together and that the absence of widespread violence since 1995 is an indicator of its success. However, there are concerns that Bosnia cannot function much longer under the Dayton system and that reforms are necessary to address the country's deep-rooted issues.\n\nCongress may consider questions such as how to encourage Bosnia's government to incorporate legal rulings into election legislation and"]}

DOJ components, including the Criminal Division and the USAOs, are responsible for identifying victims, determining losses, prosecuting cases, and negotiating plea agreements that may include restitution. The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section manages the Asset Forfeiture Program, which can use forfeited assets to pay restitution debts. The judiciary orders restitution, receives payments, and disburses payments to victims. Probation officers prepare presentence investigation reports (PSRs) that include victim information and offender financial information, which are used by the court to determine restitution orders.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of coordination between the Financial Litigation Unit (FLU) and Asset Forfeiture units to use forfeited assets to collect on unpaid restitution debts. DOJ requires each USAO to have policies and procedures for debt collection efforts but allows discretion in their development. The EOUSA provides management assistance, guidance, training, and administrative support to USAOs.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges of collecting restitution, including the large volume of outstanding debt and the difficulty of collecting from offenders who lack the ability to pay. The report recommends that the judiciary determine why USSC data on the reasons restitution was not ordered are incomplete and take action to ensure complete data recording. The Attorney General is recommended to develop and implement performance measures and goals for each USAO related to the collection of restitution and to gather information on reasons why forfeited assets were not used to compensate victims and take action to increase the use of forfeited assets to compensate eligible victims."]}

This report provides a comprehensive chronology of official responses and legislative actions during the 113th and 114th Congresses.\n\nIn response to the rising number of reported sexual assaults, the DOD and the Obama Administration took several steps. In 2012, Major General Gary S. Patton was appointed as the new director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO). The DOD also announced improvements to prospective commander and senior enlisted training and reviewed the initial military training environment in every service. In 2013, Secretary Chuck Hagel announced the establishment of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel to review and assess the effectiveness of military systems used to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate crimes involving sexual assault and related offenses.\n\nCongressional action included the introduction and passage of several bills aimed at improving military sexual assault prevention and response. In 2013, the Military Track, Register and Alert Communities Act (Military TRAC Act) was introduced to require the Department of Defense (DOD) to maintain a sex offender registry of individuals convicted of certain sex offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or of other military offenses appropriate for sex offender registration purposes. The Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included provisions to consult with victims of sexual assault regarding their preference for prosecution, create a confidential review of characterization of terms of discharge for victims, and revise requirements relating to DOD policy on retention of evidence in a sexual assault case to allow return of personal property upon completion of related proceedings.\n\nDespite these efforts, the number of reported sexual assaults continued to rise, with over 5,000 reports in 2013 and an estimated 18,900 service members experiencing unwanted sexual contact in 2014.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, provides federal assistance for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland that may become a major disaster. FMAGs can be requested by states or tribes when a fire is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. Requests should include cost estimates and information about the size and threat of the fire, as well as the availability of state and local resources.\n\nFMAGs require a cost-sharing component, with state, local, and tribal governments responsible for 25% of the expenses. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 granted tribes the ability to request FMAGs, equivalent to states in their ability to request major disaster declarations.\n\nFEMA uses criteria such as the threat to lives and property, availability of state and local resources, high fire danger conditions, and potential economic impacts to evaluate FMAG requests. The agency has developed fire cost thresholds, which vary by state, to help determine eligibility for assistance. If FEMA denies a request, the state has one opportunity to appeal within 30 days.\n\nFMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and are not contingent on the DRF balance or reductions in funding for major disasters. Eligible expenses include costs for equipment and supplies, emergency work, and personal comfort and safety items for firefighters.\n\nFMAGs are similar to other FEMA assistance programs but are not available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service or other federal agencies engaged in suppression operations. However, they may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs or cooperative agreements between federal, state, and other governmental or tribal partners.\n\nMost fires that begin on federal land are the responsibility of the federal agency that owns or manages the land and are not eligible for FMAG assistance, but there are some exceptions for fires on mixed federal and nonfederal lands."]}

IHS operates through a network of federally and tribally operated facilities, which received approximately $1.9 billion in funding in fiscal year 2017. Federally operated IHS facilities offer mostly primary and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and specialty services, and employ both federal civil service personnel and Commissioned Corps officers. However, these facilities face significant challenges in recruiting and retaining providers due to rural locations, geographic isolation, and limited amenities.\n\nAccording to the National Rural Health Association, challenges of rural health care delivery differ from those in urban areas, including complex patient health status, poorer socioeconomic conditions, and physician workforce shortages. IHS data demonstrate large percentages of vacancies for providers in areas with substantial direct care responsibilities, with overall vacancy rates ranging from 13 to 31 percent and vacancy rates for certain provider types exceeding 25 percent in some areas. For example, 29 percent of total positions for physicians were vacant, ranging from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. Similarly, 27 percent of total positions for dentists were vacant, ranging from 14 percent in the Phoenix area to 39 percent in the Bemidji area.\n\nTo address these challenges, IHS has implemented various recruitment and retention strategies, including financial incentives, professional development opportunities, and some access to housing. IHS also offers increased special salary rates for certain health care positions, student loan repayments, and recruitment and retention bonuses. However, despite these efforts, IHS continues to face resource constraints and struggles to meet the demand for these incentives.\n\nIHS officials have reported that rural locations and geographic isolation create recruitment and retention difficulties, with 36 of the 102 IHS facilities identified as isolated hardship (ISOHAR) posts.

The missing documentation included focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and retrospective reviews. In some cases, these reviews were not conducted at all. The VA medical centers also did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews delayed for months or even years.\n\nThe lack of documentation and untimely reviews stemmed from VHA policy not requiring documentation of all types of reviews or setting a timeliness requirement for initiating them. Additionally, VHA's oversight of the reviews was inadequate, with networks responsible for overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes but no routine oversight of the reviews themselves.\n\nAs a result, VA medical center officials lacked the necessary information to make decisions about providers' privileges and take adverse privileging actions when appropriate. Furthermore, VA's failure to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required allowed substandard providers to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or outside facilities.\n\nThe report found that five VA medical centers failed to report nine providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required, despite these providers having significant clinical deficiencies that sometimes resulted in adverse outcomes for veterans. In some cases, providers were terminated for cause but not reported, and in others, officials were unaware of VHA policies related to reporting or misinterpreted them.\n\nTo address these issues, the report recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA should require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards and that this reporting is timely."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe Congressional Review Act (CRA) is a law that allows Congress to review and overturn certain types of federal agency actions, known as \"rules,\" within a specific timeframe. The CRA was enacted in 1996 and requires agencies to submit rules to Congress before they can take effect. The CRA defines a rule as a statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA also provides expedited procedures for Congress to consider and vote on a joint resolution of disapproval to overturn a rule.\n\nThe CRA has been used to overturn both regulations that went through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures and guidance documents that were not subject to those procedures. The use of the CRA to overturn a guidance document raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use it to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures.\n\nThe CRA's expedited procedures for considering a joint resolution of disapproval include a petition signed by at least 30 Senators to discharge a committee from further consideration, a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider the resolution, and up to 10 hours of debate and a simple majority vote to pass the resolution. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it is sent to the President for signature or veto. If the President vetoes the resolution, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote in each house.\n\nThe CRA applies to rules promulgated by a federal agency, as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which includes most executive branch entities. However, the CRA does not apply to rules issued by the President or orders or investigative acts.\n\nDetermining whether an agency action is a rule subject to the CRA requires a two-step inquiry: first, asking whether the statement qualifies as a rule under the APA definition, and second, asking whether the statement falls within any of the exceptions to the CRA's definition of rule.

VA has encountered difficulties in converting or disposing of these buildings due to their historic status and the high cost of renovation or demolition.\n\nVA has also struggled to engage stakeholders effectively, leading to adversarial relationships and reduced ability to align facilities with veterans' needs. Two of VA's planning processes, VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP), have limitations that hinder VA's efforts. The SCIP process, which VA uses to plan and prioritize capital projects, has subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, making it difficult for VA to accurately identify the capital necessary to address service and infrastructure gaps.\n\nThe VAIP process produces market-level health services delivery plans and facility master plans for each Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and medical facility, but it assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate given VA's use of non-VA providers.

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) goes further, requiring Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs) to report detailed information about their U.S. customers' accounts annually. FATCA applies to taxpayers with specified foreign financial assets whose aggregate value exceeds certain thresholds and requires them to report these assets and income generated from them to the IRS on Form 8938. Thresholds vary based on filing status and residency. FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which it is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report account information of their U.S. customers.\n\nThe IRS reported that FATCA improves visibility into taxable income from foreign sources and enhances its ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. FATCA allows the IRS to compare information reported by FFIs on Forms 8966 to information reported by U.S. persons on Forms 8938, ensuring taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets and income from international investments.\n\nHowever, the IRS faces challenges in matching account information collected from FFIs to the account's owner due to incorrect or missing Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs). In July 2018, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found that almost half of new Forms 8966 filed by FFIs did not include a TIN or included an invalid TIN. FFIs encountered significant challenges obtaining accurate TINs from U.S. persons during the self-certification process. Banking associations reported that it took time, effort, and expense for FFIs to report TINs, as they had to upgrade computer systems to collect and record TINs from U.S. customers.

The majority of this funding, around $1.8 trillion, went to the Department of Defense (DOD), with $154 billion going to the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and $3 billion to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard. The report serves as a reference for emergency requirement and OCO/GWOT funding, as well as related budgetary and policy issues.\n\nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has relied on supplemental appropriations to fund war-related activities, with the largest portion going to DOD. Supplemental appropriations provide flexibility for policymakers to address unforeseen needs, but they have also caused debate over whether they should only be used for emergencies or if they should also provide funding for activities that could reasonably be covered in regular appropriations acts.\n\nFrom FY2001 to FY2009, DOD received $1.8 trillion in appropriations for OCO/GWOT, averaging 17% of the department's total budget authority. The department's OCO funding peaked in FY2008, both in terms of nominal dollars and as a share of its discretionary spending, after the Bush Administration surged additional U.S. military personnel to Iraq. The department's OCO funding also increased following the Obama Administration's deployment of more U.S. military personnel to Afghanistan and in response to enactment of legislation in response to the Trump Administration's request for additional appropriations.\n\nIn terms of appropriations titles, more than two-thirds of OCO/GWOT funding since FY2001 has been for Operation and Maintenance (O&M), which pays for the operating costs of the military such as fuel, maintenance, and mobilization of forces.

From 1998 to 2003, the DRC was involved in \"Africa's World War,\" resulting in a death toll of an estimated 5 million people. The eastern DRC continues to experience violence, with illegal armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military perpetrating human rights abuses, including sexual violence against civilians.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, requires companies to disclose the use of conflict minerals, specifically tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, originating from the DRC and covered countries. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a disclosure rule in response to the Act in 2012. The rule requires companies to determine the origin of these minerals, conduct due diligence to ensure they are not financing or benefiting armed groups, and report their findings to the SEC.\n\nIn 2017, the SEC reported that 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures, similar to the number in 2016 and 2015. Almost all of these companies reported performing country-of-origin inquiries and conducting due diligence if necessary. However, most companies reported challenges in determining the country of origin of their conflict minerals due to complex supply chains and lack of access to suppliers.\n\nThe SEC also reported that an estimated 37% of companies were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, while 47% could not definitively confirm the source. Only three of the 16 companies that reported determining that their minerals did not finance or benefit armed groups included the required independent private-sector audit report.\n\nThe report also highlights the ongoing issue of sexual violence in the DRC and neighboring countries, with cases documented by the United Nations and U.S. Department of State.

The report found that FCC's data collection process, which relies on unverified information from providers, has led to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. To address this issue, the report recommends that FCC develop methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, establish a formal process for tribal input, and obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC's tribal engagement guidance. The report also found that FCC's tribal engagement requirement, which requires providers to meaningfully engage with tribes regarding communications services, has had varying levels of success, with some providers treating tribal engagement as a \"box to check\" and others working closely with tribes. The report recommends that FCC seek additional feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers to determine whether clarification of its tribal engagement statement is needed. The report also found that FCC's data collection programs, including the Form 477 process, do not collect data on factors affecting broadband access, such as affordability and service quality, outside of the Form 477 process. The report recommends that FCC consider collecting more granular data related to these factors to better understand the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services. The report concludes by recommending that the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission develop and implement the methods and processes outlined in the report to improve the accuracy of broadband data for tribal lands and ensure that tribal governments and providers are sharing information to foster improved services on tribal lands."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions, focusing on the most burdensome regulations and actions taken by federal regulators to reduce this burden. Community banks and credit unions were identified based on their fewer total assets, traditional lending and deposit-taking activities, limited geographic scope, and lack of complex operating structures. The most burdensome regulations were found to be those related to mortgage fee and term disclosures to consumers, mortgage borrower and loan characteristics reporting, and anti-money laundering activities.\n\nTo identify the burdensome characteristics of these regulations, focus groups were conducted with community banks and credit unions. The results showed that these institutions had to take various actions to comply with the regulations, including hiring or expanding staff resources, investing in additional information technology resources, and conducting staff training.\n\nThe report also discusses the potential benefits of these regulations from the perspective of consumer groups. To determine whether regulators had required institutions to comply with provisions from which they might be exempt, eight exemptions from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were identified, and a small group of recent examinations were reviewed.\n\nFederal financial regulators' efforts to reduce the existing regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions were assessed by reviewing laws and congressional and agency documentation, Federal Register notices, comment letters, and transcripts of public forums. The regulators identified areas of their regulations that were outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome through the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996.\n\nThe report concludes by interviewing representatives from CFPB, FDIC, Federal Reserve, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, NCUA, and OCC to identify any steps taken to reduce the compliance burden associated with each of the identified regulations and to understand how they conduct retrospective reviews."]}

The program is intended to improve grants management processes, reduce labor-intensive manual processes, and enhance information sharing and reporting capabilities. The current grants management environment consists of 45 grant programs, managed across four divisions, with an estimated 5,000 internal and hundreds of thousands of external users. The legacy systems are disparate and non-interoperable, leading to poor information sharing, labor-intensive manual processes, and difficulty reconciling financial data.\n\nGMM is expected to cost approximately $251 million, with initial operational capability achieved by September 2019 and full operational capability by September 2020. The program is being developed using a combination of commercial-off-the-shelf software, open source software, and custom developed code, and relies on an Agile software development approach. The program is also intended to address cybersecurity concerns, as the legacy systems have been identified as having vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, the program has faced challenges, including delays in awarding contracts, lack of standardization in grant management data, and the need to interface with other systems, such as financial management systems and national flood insurance systems. The program is also in the process of removing a key performance parameter related to financial systems interoperability and timeliness of data exchanged.\n\nEffective business process reengineering and IT requirements management are critical for the successful design, development, and delivery of new IT systems. FEMA has taken steps to document current and target grants management business processes, establish clear, prioritized, and traceable IT requirements, and incorporate input from end user stakeholders. However, the program lacks a finalized organizational change management plan and has not fully addressed all leading practices for business process reengineering and IT requirements management.\n\nThe program is also in the process of updating its cost estimate to reflect current assumptions and implementing a more repeatable transition planning process.

The program, which began in 1972, was administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and funded through annual appropriations. By the mid-1980s, there was debate over the future of the construction grants program, with some arguing for a phaseout due to the elimination of the backlog of sewage treatment needs and the belief that state and local governments were capable of funding their own projects. In response, Congress passed the Water Quality Act of 1987, which authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction through a combination of Title II grants and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program. The CWSRF program provided federal grants as seed money for state-administered loans to build sewage treatment plants and eventually replace the Title II grants program in FY1991.\n\nSince the enactment of the 1987 amendments, appropriations for wastewater and drinking infrastructure programs have totaled over $100 billion. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. The funding needs for both wastewater and drinking water infrastructure remain high, with an estimated $271 billion needed for all types of projects eligible for funding under the CWA and $473 billion needed for public drinking water supplies in the United States over the next 20 years.\n\nThe practice of earmarking funds for specific projects began in the late 1980s and continued through the 2000s, with the number of projects and the average size of grants decreasing over time. The effective result was a reduction in the amount of funds provided to states to capitalize their SRF programs. Between 1989 and 2010, approximately 10% of the total water infrastructure appropriations ($7.4 billion) went to earmarked project grants. The practice was criticized for undermining the intended purpose of the state funds and delaying the time when SRFs would be financially self-sufficient.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to reform the appropriations process and reduce"]}

FERC does not construct, own, or operate dams, but it sets safety standards and conducts inspections.\n\nFERC requires licensees to have an Owner's Dam Safety Program and conduct regular safety inspections, independent consultant inspections, and potential failure mode analyses. During relicensing, FERC evaluates safety, environmental, recreational, cultural, and resource development factors. FERC's approach to recording inspection information is inconsistent, using multiple systems and affording broad discretion to staff on how to characterize findings. FERC plans to replace the OEP-IT system with a new system to improve the consistency of recorded information.\n\nFERC's dam safety oversight approach includes ensuring licensees have a safety program, conducting regular inspections, reviewing technical analyses, and analyzing safety as part of project relicensing. FERC uses a risk-based review process, focusing on three primary engineering studies (hydrology, seismicity, and stability), and requires independent consultant inspections every 5 years for high hazard dams. FERC staff review engineering studies more frequently for high hazard dams and less frequently for low hazard dams.\n\nFERC's review process includes multiple levels of supervisory review, with staff rotating assignments and responsibilities every 3 to 4 years to minimize the risk of missing important safety-related items.

The report distinguishes between long-term leases and short-term rentals, with the latter being used for infrequently used equipment. In 2013, GSA began offering heavy equipment through its Short-Term Rental program to eliminate ownership and maintenance costs.\n\nThe report provides data on the number, type, and cost of heavy equipment owned by 20 federal agencies as of June 2017. These agencies reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items, with the Department of Defense owning the largest share. The report also discusses how these agencies decided to purchase or lease heavy equipment during 2012-2016, and how they manage the utilization of their heavy equipment.\n\nThe report highlights the lack of central reporting requirements for agencies' heavy equipment inventories and the need for each agency to maintain inventory controls. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to consider the cost and other factors when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment.

These events can occur within months or years of each other. Key acquisition documents, such as the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), require department-level approval before a program moves to the next acquisition phase. The APB establishes a program\u2019s schedule, costs, and key performance parameters.\n\nPrograms that fail to meet any schedule, cost, or performance threshold approved in the APB are considered to be in breach. Programs in breach are required to notify their acquisition decision authority and develop a remediation plan. The Acquisition Review Board, chaired by the acquisition decision authority or a designee, reviews major acquisition programs for proper management, oversight, accountability, and alignment with the department\u2019s strategic functions. The Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management (PARM) is responsible for DHS\u2019s overall acquisition governance process and supports the Acquisition Review Board.\n\nComponents, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation Security Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard, sponsor specific acquisition programs. The head of each component is responsible for oversight of major acquisition programs once they complete delivery of all planned capabilities to end users. Component Acquisition Executives within the components are responsible for overseeing the execution of their respective portfolios. Program management offices, also within the components, are responsible for planning and executing DHS\u2019s individual programs.\n\nDHS established the Joint Requirements Council (JRC) to develop and lead a component-driven"]}

The Navy has experienced significant readiness decline due to more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty, and reductions in force structure. The Navy and Marine Corps have made progress in identifying the causes of their readiness decline and have begun efforts to address it, but full resolution will require years of sustained management attention.\n\nThe Navy has faced persistent challenges in completing maintenance on time and providing sufficient manning to its ships. These challenges have resulted in maintenance delays, increased costs, and reduced training and operational availability. The Navy has also struggled to maintain an adequate number of fighter pilots, which has negatively impacted training and retention.\n\nThe Marine Corps has faced challenges in sustaining its aircraft fleet, including aging aircraft, depot maintenance complexities, and spare parts availability. The Marine Corps is also in the process of procuring the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, which is projected to have sustainment costs exceeding $1 trillion over its 60-year life cycle. The F-35 fleet has faced numerous sustainment challenges, including parts shortages and repair delays, which have impacted readiness and increased maintenance costs.\n\nThe report contains 25 specific recommendations for the Navy and Marine Corps and an additional 20 recommendations for various other DOD components to assist in rebuilding the readiness of their forces and modernizing for the future. The Department of Defense has concurred with most of the recommendations and has many actions underway, but full implementation has not been achieved.

{"samples": ["\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD,) was established in 1934 during the Great Depression to encourage lending for housing and stimulate the construction industry. FHA insures private mortgage lenders against the risk of borrower default on certain mortgage loans. Eligible mortgages must be originated by approved lenders and meet specific criteria. FHA is the most broadly targeted of the three federal mortgage insurance programs, as its availability is not limited by factors such as veteran status, income, or rural area location. However, the availability or attractiveness of FHA-insured mortgages may be limited by factors like maximum mortgage amounts, insurance fees, and eligibility standards.\n\nFHA's creation marked a turning point in the mortgage market by introducing 20-year mortgages with full repayment at the end of the loan term. Prior to FHA, few mortgages exceeded 50% of a property's value, and most had short terms and required lump sum payments or renegotiation at the end. During the Great Depression, many borrowers lost their homes through foreclosure due to inability to refinance mortgages, leading to lender losses as property values declined. FHA's insurance protected lenders against these losses, instilling confidence in the mortgage market and contributing to the growth of long-term mortgages.\n\nToday, FHA aims to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for some households who might not be well-served by the private market. It also plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market by insuring mortgages during economic downturns when mortgage credit availability tightens. FHA-insured mortgages have lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than many conventional mortgages, making them attractive to first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities.\n\nFHA-insured mortgages are available for purchasing or refinancing a single-family home, and borrowers must intend to occupy the property as their principal residence. Eligibility is determined based on factors like credit, financial status, monthly shelter expenses, and debts. Borrowers with previous mortgage foreclosures are generally ineligible for three years.

The Navy's proposed FY2019 budget requests $2.3 billion for the CVN-78 program, which could significantly impact Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 ( Harry S. Truman ), and instead retire the ship around FY2024 and deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings. However, this proposal was later withdrawn, and the Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping the ship in service past FY2024.\n\nThe Navy's current aircraft carrier force consists of 11 nuclear-powered ships, and the requirement to maintain a force of not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers is established by law. The Navy aims to achieve and maintain a fleet of 355 ships, including 12 aircraft carriers. Procuring carriers on 3-year centers would achieve a 12-carrier force on a sustained basis by about 2030, while procuring on 4-year centers would take longer.\n\nThe Navy's FY2020 budget submission shows the $618 million in FY2019 funding for CVN-81 as full funding, but DOD's decision to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020 instead of FY2019 affects the comparison of numbers of ships procured in FY2019 and FY2020 and the aircraft carrier procurement profile during the initial years of the 30-year shipbuilding plan.\n\nCongressional oversight questions include compliance with congressional intent, the executability of FY2019 procurement funds for CVN-81 during a continuing resolution, and the effect of the decision on the number of ships procured and the aircraft carrier procurement profile.

The ISC's mandate includes developing and evaluating security standards, ensuring compliance, and overseeing implementation of security measures. The ISC Standard prescribes a risk-management process for federal agencies to follow in conducting risk assessments for their facilities. Agencies are required to consider all undesirable events, assess threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, and document decisions that deviate from the ISC Standard.\n\nFour federal agencies - Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and United States Forest Service (Forest Service) - were reviewed for their adherence to the ISC Standard. None of the agencies fully aligned with the Standard, as they did not consider all undesirable events or assess all three factors of risk for each event. CBP and FAA have begun improving their methodologies, while ARS and Forest Service are following a USDA assessment methodology.\n\nThe agencies reported challenges in conducting assessments and monitoring results, including competing priorities, insufficient resources, and lack of a long-term assessment schedule. To address these challenges, recommendations include updating policies and procedures, implementing a long-term assessment schedule, and improving data collection and analysis.\n\nThe ISC's risk management process is crucial for federal agencies to identify necessary countermeasures and ensure the security of their facilities.

{"samples": ["\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate, as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002. The PERM measures errors in three components of Medicaid: FFS, managed care, and eligibility. The FFS component measures errors in claims for services and payments to providers, while the managed care component assesses errors in capitated payments to managed care organizations (MCOs). The eligibility component, which has not been calculated since 2014, measures errors in state determinations of enrollee eligibility.\n\nThe managed care component of the PERM measures the accuracy of capitated payments made by state Medicaid agencies to MCOs. Capitated payments are periodic payments that reflect the average cost to provide covered services to enrollees. The PERM review contractor examines whether state agencies made capitated payments only for eligible enrollees, made payments for the correct amount based on the contract and coverage requirements, made payments based on the correct rate for enrollees, and did not make any duplicate payments.\n\nHowever, the PERM does not account for other program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, such as overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. Among the 27 audits and investigations of Medicaid managed care programs reviewed, 10 identified about $68 million in MCO overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for in PERM estimates. One investigation of an MCO operating in nine states resulted in a $137.5 million settlement to resolve allegations of false claims.\n\nCMS has taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care, including updated regulations, Focused Program Integrity Reviews, and collaborative audits. However, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable costs, which could inflate future capitation rates and result in higher state and federal spending. CMS should consider taking additional steps to mitigate these risks, such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care."]}

Monetary policy is used to stabilize business cycles and maintain full employment and stable prices. The Fed's primary tool is setting the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates and economic activity.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to near zero to combat the economic downturn. It also employed unconventional measures, such as emergency credit facilities and quantitative easing (QE), to provide additional monetary stimulus. The Fed's balance sheet grew significantly during this period, leading to an increase in bank reserves.\n\nQE aimed to reduce long-term interest rates by purchasing securities, with the hope that lower rates would stimulate spending. The Fed conducted three rounds of QE between 2009 and 2014, resulting in a balance sheet five times larger than before the crisis.\n\nThe Fed's exit strategy from QE and zero interest rates involves gradually reducing the balance sheet by ceasing to roll over securities as they mature. It plans to continue implementing monetary policy by targeting the federal funds rate, despite the excess reserves in the market. The Fed intends to maintain abundant bank reserves to avoid using open market operations to respond to changes in banks' demand for reserves.\n\nThe Fed's regulatory responsibilities include bank supervision, regulation of nonbank systemically important financial institutions, and regulation of the payment system.

{"samples": ["\nThe Buy American Act of 1933 requires the federal government to prioritize purchasing domestic end products. However, there are exceptions and waivers to this requirement, such as when a domestic end product is not produced in sufficient quantities or the cost is unreasonable. The Act applies to end products, and not the location of the vendor. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 allows for waivers of the Buy American Act for certain acquisitions from countries that are party to international trade agreements or designated countries. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) sets forth exceptions and procedures for federal agencies to follow when procuring foreign end products.\n\nThe Buy American Act applies to end products that are manufactured in the United States if they are commercially available off-the-shelf items or the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of all components. End products that do not meet these criteria are considered foreign.\n\nThe Buy American Act's applicability is based on the country of origin of the product, not the vendor's location. Vendors are required to certify where their products are manufactured or produced, either through the federal government's contractor registry, the System for Award Management (SAM), or in their individual offers for contracts. Contracting officials include relevant clauses in solicitations and contracts to require vendor certification.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for the acquisition of foreign end products, which accounts for less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations for end products. However, there are differences in how civilian agencies and the Department of Defense (DOD) apply Buy American Act exceptions and waivers. In a review of 38 contracts and orders from four agencies, six instances were found where the place of manufacture information was misreported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). Additionally, there are system limitations in how FPDS-NG captures information, such as the lack of an option to indicate whether a contract is under the micro-purchase threshold and the requirement for contracting officers to still report the place of manufacture for awards under the micro-purchase amount, even though no exception is needed at these dollar levels.\n\nAgencies reported obligating over $700"]}

{"samples": ["\nThe Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). Railroad workers receive retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits, while those with nonrailroad experience receive benefits from either railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, with recent years seeing increases after reaching an all-time low in 2010. The railroad retirement program is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Payroll taxes are the largest funding source and are divided into Tier I and Tier II taxes. Tier I taxes are the same as Social Security payroll taxes, while Tier II taxes are based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs.\n\nRailroad retirement benefits include retirement, survivor, disability, and unemployment and sickness benefits. Eligibility for retirement benefits is based on at least 10 years of covered railroad work or 5 years performed after 1995 and insured status under Social Security rules. Beneficiaries may include family members, and if a worker does not qualify for railroad retirement benefits, their railroad work counts toward Social Security benefits. In FY2017, $12.5 billion in benefits were paid, with 60.0% going to retirement annuities, 8.0% to disability annuities, 14.4% to spouse annuities, and 16.8% to survivor annuities. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits but can be more generous in certain situations.\n\nRailroad unemployment and sickness benefits are financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes and are paid in addition to any paid leave or private insurance an employee may have.

With approximately 340,000 employees, VA relies heavily on IT infrastructure to provide services and benefits.\n\nAs of October 2016, VA had 576 active or in-development IT systems, with 319 of these systems being used by VHA. Of these, 244 were considered mission-related and provided capabilities related to veterans' health care delivery. VHA's flagship system, VistA, is an integrated medical information system for veterans' health information, developed in-house since the early 1980s. VistA consists of over 200 applications and is vital to ensuring the quality of health care received by veterans and their dependents. However, the system's age and complexity have made it increasingly difficult and costly to maintain.\n\nVA has identified unaddressed needs in its current health IT systems, including the lack of interoperability and the inability to fully support organizational business functions.

Climate change is causing both slow-onset disasters, such as sea level rise and drought, and sudden-onset disasters, such as floods. These effects can alter existing migration trends and force people to migrate due to the loss of livelihoods and critical services. The report notes that while international and U.S. government sources agree that climate change poses serious risks, there is debate about the role it plays in migration. The report also highlights the limitations of reliable data on environmental migrants and the potential national security challenges that climate change-induced migration may pose.\n\nThe report discusses the role of State, USAID, and DOD in responding to climate change-related issues, including migration. State interacts with foreign governments and international organizations through the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (State/OES) and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM). USAID supports a range of development programs that help mitigate the effects of climate change and provides emergency responses to sudden- and slow-onset disasters. DOD assists in humanitarian response to sudden-onset disasters abroad through its geographic combatant commands.\n\nThe report notes that climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of policy documents during the previous administrations. However, the report also highlights the shift in priorities related to climate change between the past two administrations, with the previous administration issuing executive orders and presidential memorandums related to climate change and the current administration revoking some of these actions.

{"samples": ["\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly address questions of emergency power, leading to varied and ad hoc answers throughout history. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 is an example of a twentieth-century delegation of emergency authority, granting the President extensive power to regulate economic transactions during a state of emergency. IEEPA was enacted to rein in the expansive emergency economic powers granted to the President under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). However, some scholars argue that subsequent actions have expanded IEEPA into a source of unchecked executive authority.\n\nThe report discusses the historical context of emergency powers in the United States, starting with the First World War and the expansive economic mobilization efforts. The use of TWEA during this period granted the President exceptional control over private international economic transactions in times of war. The Great Depression saw a blurring of lines between the executive's military and economic powers, leading to the delegation of discretionary authority to the executive in peacetime.\n\nIEEPA was enacted in response to this trend, but its scope and use have been a subject of debate. Some argue that it has been used to implement the will of Congress or as encouraged by congressional activity. Others argue that it has subverted the rule of law.\n\nThe report also discusses recent presidential actions that have drawn attention to presidential emergency powers under the National Emergencies Act (NEA), of which IEEPA is a part. Congress may consider addressing two issues related to IEEPA and the NEA: how Congress has delegated its authority and the choices made in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.\n\nIn summary, the report discusses the historical context and debates surrounding the issue of emergency power in the United States, with a focus on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and its relationship to the National Emergencies Act.

The pipeline sector is responsible for self-identifying critical facilities and reporting them to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which conducts Critical Facility Security Reviews (CFSRs) at these facilities. However, the report found that at least 34 of the top 100 critical pipeline systems did not identify any critical facilities, which means TSA did not conduct a CFSR at any of these systems.\n\nThe report also highlighted the need for TSA to update its Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool, which has not been revised since 2014. The tool assesses threat, vulnerability, and consequence for pipeline systems, but it lacks current data and does not fully account for cybersecurity threats or natural hazards. The report recommended that TSA document its data sources, update the tool with current information, and align it with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and other DHS priorities for critical infrastructure risk mitigation.\n\nThe report also emphasized the importance of a feedback mechanism to measure the progress pipeline companies make in addressing vulnerability gaps between security reviews. The current risk assessment includes a Corporate Security Review (CSR) score as part of its vulnerability calculation, but pipeline companies consider security factors differently, leading to variation in implementing risk reduction activities and different CSR scores. The report suggested that developing a feedback mechanism based on implementation of TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines could be an important input to the risk assessment\u2019s vulnerability calculation.\n\nFinally, the report highlighted the need for TSA to consider cross-sector interdependencies, which could affect vulnerability calculations. The pipeline sector is interconnected with other critical infrastructure sectors, such as the electrical grid, and disruptions in one sector could have cascading impacts on other sectors. The report recommended that TSA consider interdependencies of sectors in both directions to improve the calculations in the pipeline risk assessment.\n\nIn summary, the report found that the TSA\u2019s pipeline risk assessment lacks current data, does not fully account for cybersecurity threats and natural hazards, and could benefit from a feedback mechanism and consideration of cross-sector interdependencies to improve its accuracy and effectiveness in prioritizing"]}

The report also mentions the weaknesses in the Department of Defense's (DOD) approach to estimating and reporting on the total cost of its global defense posture.\n\nSince 2009, GAO has reported on these issues, recommending that DOD issue guidance for estimating total costs for global defense posture and modify its annual report to Congress to include the total cost to complete each planned posture initiative. DOD agreed with these recommendations and took steps to implement them.\n\nIn 2014, the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) was announced, with three of its lines of effort expected to enhance DOD's posture in Europe. These efforts include increasing forces present in Europe, enhancing the footprint, and implementing new host nation agreements. DOD has requested increased funding to support these initiatives, with approximately $4.5 billion requested through the end of fiscal year 2017.\n\nHowever, the report also notes that DOD is planning ERI's posture initiatives outside of its established processes and is funding these enduring initiatives out of its OCO budget. This approach has risks, including the potential completion of unnecessary construction projects and a lack of visibility into the amount of funding being spent on operations and maintenance-funded construction projects. EUCOM is using DOD's OCO budget to fund construction projects and is planning those projects outside of its established processes, similar to U.S. Central Command.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in its base budget, develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure projects under ERI, and provide to Congress estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and other enduring costs, including assumptions such as those pertaining to the level of host nation support and burden sharing."]}

FRA oversees safety on the general rail system, which includes freight and intercity passenger railroads, while FTA regulates safety on rail transit systems, such as heavy and light rail, streetcars, and bus rapid transit. Rail transit systems provided over 4.4 billion passenger trips in 2016, with heavy rail accounting for 88% of these trips.\n\nThe FTA's state safety oversight program relies on states to conduct safety oversight of rail transit systems. However, challenges have been identified in this program, including insufficient staffing and training of state safety agencies. In response, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required states to designate an agency to oversee rail transit safety, and MAP-21, enacted in 2012, enhanced FTA's authority to oversee the safety of rail transit systems.\n\nMAP-21 established a comprehensive Public Transportation Safety Program, which requires each eligible state to have a state safety oversight program certified by FTA within three years. These programs must have a state safety agency with appropriate staffing, financial and legal independence, investigative and enforcement authority, and the ability to remove deficient equipment from service or assess fines.\n\nBoth FRA and FTA have mechanisms to gather stakeholder input when considering development of safety regulations. FRA uses its Railroad Safety Advisory Committee, while FTA collaborates with industry stakeholders through a working group and solicits comments on its compilation of existing rail transit safety standards.\n\nFRA ensures compliance with its safety regulations through inspections, audits, and investigations, while FTA utilizes its new inspection authorities to supplement state safety agency oversight. FRA also uses civil penalties and compliance agreements to resolve safety issues, while FTA can withhold federal funding for rail transit operators or assume direct safety oversight if necessary.\n\nDespite these efforts, rail safety incidents continue to occur, highlighting the need for ongoing oversight and improvement.

The program began in 2010 and has since narrowed down the number of participants, with NASA relying on commercial companies to propose specifics related to their crew transportation systems. In the early phases, NASA provided technical support and funding under Space Act agreements, which allowed greater flexibility and did not require adherence to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). In the final phases, NASA awarded FAR-based contracts, enabling the procurement of missions to the International Space Station (ISS) while continuing to provide technical expertise and funding.\n\nThe program established a verification closure notice process, requiring contractors to submit data to NASA to verify they have met all requirements for certification. NASA levied two sets of requirements on the contractors: ISS program requirements and Commercial Crew Program requirements, with a focus on system capabilities and safety. In 2014, NASA awarded firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX for the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase, valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Both companies are developing crew transportation systems, with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon 2.\n\nThe Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase contracts include three types of services: design, development, test, and evaluation work for certification, service missions to transport astronauts to and from the ISS, and studies, tests, and analyses requested by NASA. As of April 2018, NASA had funded approximately $74 million in studies for both contractors.\n\nThe program faces challenges, including schedule pressures and the need for a contingency plan to ensure uninterrupted access to the ISS if certification is delayed. NASA has recommended developing a contingency plan and reporting to Congress on the results. The program also faces challenges related to loss of crew as a safety threshold, with inconsistent approaches and a lack of plans to capture lessons learned.

{"samples": ["\nThe banking industry plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy by connecting borrowers and savers and allocating funds. However, banking involves inherent risks, and the financial system has experienced significant crises and failures throughout history. Regulatory systems have evolved to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks, and Congress continues to consider policies related to the banking industry.\n\nThe last decade has seen transformative changes in banking, including the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which threatened the collapse of the financial system and the real economy. The crisis revealed weaknesses in the pre-crisis financial regulatory regime, leading to numerous changes to financial regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Accords.\n\nSome argue that these regulatory changes have potential benefits, such as better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, and potentially higher long-term economic growth. However, concerns have been raised about the potential costs, including compliance costs for banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, and slower economic growth.\n\nIn response, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act) to modify certain regulations, particularly for small and mid-sized banks. Regulators have also proposed further changes. The implementation of these regulatory changes and the debate over their effectiveness will continue to draw congressional attention.\n\nBanks face a range of regulations to ensure they are profitable without being excessively risky, reduce the use of banking services for criminal activities, and protect against cyberattacks. These regulations include capital requirements, anti-money laundering measures, and cybersecurity regulations.\n\nCapital requirements aim to increase banks' ability to absorb losses and reduce the likelihood and size of potential losses. The Volcker Rule restricts proprietary trading to reduce excessive risks. The EGRRCP Act mandated certain changes to these prudential regulations, and regulators have proposed further changes.\n\nThe banking sector continues to face market and economic trends, including the development of new technologies and a rising interest rate environment following an extended period of low rates. These trends will impact the banking industry and the implementation of new regulation."]}
{"samples": ["\nColombia, a country in the Western Hemisphere with a population of over 50 million, has endured a decades-long civil conflict between the government and various armed groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). The conflict, which began in the late 1940s, resulted in the deaths of over 220,000 people, 81% of whom were civilians. The conflict also led to the displacement of over 5 million Colombians, as well as the kidnapping of over 27,000 people and the death or injury of over 11,000 from anti-personnel land mines.\n\nDespite the conflict, Colombia has made significant progress in recent years. Between 2000 and 2016, the country saw a 94% decrease in kidnappings and a 53% reduction in homicides. Colombia has also opened its economy and promoted trade, investment, and growth, becoming one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment.\n\nHowever, Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017, primarily due to its dependence on oil and other commodity exports. To address this, the Colombian government held formal peace talks with the FARC from 2012 to 2016, resulting in a 300-page peace agreement that was narrowly defeated in a popular referendum but later revised and ratified by the Colombian Congress.\n\nThe conflict in Colombia predates the formal founding of the FARC in 1964, with its roots in the peasant self-defense groups of the 1940s and 1950s. Colombian political life has long been marked by polarization and violence based on significant disparities and inequalities suffered by landless peasants in the country's peripheral regions. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the dominance of the Liberal and Conservative parties in Colombian political life, with violence and competition between the parties leading to a period of extreme violence known as La Violencia in 1948.

{"samples": ["\nThe Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the U.S. policy for potential federal payment for third-party damages resulting from commercial launch or reentry accidents. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues licenses for commercial launches and reentries, and determines Minimum Property Liability (MPL) values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. In 2016, FAA issued five active licenses with an average third-party MPL of $51 million. The MPL value is intended to reflect the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected from a launch or reentry accident. FAA calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government, with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 10 million chance for third-party damages and a 1 in 100,000 chance for federal government damages.\n\nFAA's process for determining the MPL value includes estimating the number of casualties, the cost of casualties, and property damage. The agency uses a risk profile method to estimate the number of potential casualties, which replaced the overlay method in 2016. FAA also revised the factor it uses to estimate losses due to property damage, based on tests of a new process for estimating such losses.\n\nHowever, the FAA's report to Congress did not fully address the requirements of the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988. The act required FAA to ensure a balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government, consider the cost impact of implementing an updated MPL methodology, and consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology. Without fully addressing these requirements, FAA cannot ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended or that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary.\n\nFAA officials told us that their updated methodology is technically more valid and improves their ability to avoid overestimating or significantly underestimating MPL values.

Three of these incidents involved ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy currently has 277 ships, a 17% reduction from the 333 ships it had in 1998. As the number of ships has decreased, the number of ships deployed overseas has remained constant, leading to increased deployment lengths and reduced training and maintenance periods. This has resulted in declining ship conditions and increased maintenance times, compressing the time ships are available for training and operations.\n\nTo maintain presence and rapid crisis response, the Navy has doubled the percentage of the fleet assigned to overseas homeports since 2006. However, this comes at a cost, including higher operations and support costs and difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. The Navy's high operational tempo for ships homeported overseas limits dedicated training and maintenance periods, resulting in crews not having all needed training and certifications.\n\nThe Navy's material condition has also declined, with casualty reports nearly doubling from 2009 to 2014 and decreasing even faster for overseas-homeported ships. The Navy has acknowledged the increasing number of casualty reports and the negative effects on fleet operations. In 2015, the Navy recommended developing a comprehensive assessment of the long-term costs and risks to its fleet associated with overseas homeporting. However, as of August 2017, this assessment had not been conducted.\n\nThe Navy has faced challenges in manning its ships, including the difficulty in filling authorized positions and the potential for overworking sailors.

{"samples": ["\nThe report analyzes digital services taxes (DSTs) proposed in European countries from an economic and policy perspective. The term \"digital economy\" refers to various economic activities conducted over the internet, and some jurisdictions have targeted specific business models for selective taxation. Proponents of DSTs argue that multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy are not paying their \"fair share\" of taxes or deriving profits from consumers in their jurisdictions. However, U.S. opposition to these unilateral taxes has been expressed by government officials and Members of Congress.\n\nMNCs in the digital economy operate in \"two-sided markets,\" providing services to individual users and businesses. They can provide services without establishing a physical presence in the country where their customers reside and can shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Permanent establishment rules, which establish the right for a country to tax a corporation's income or profits earned from sales in that country, might not be triggered by digital activities over the internet. Transfer pricing rules dictate how profits from transactions between related entities within an MNC should be divided among multiple countries for tax purposes.\n\nDST proposals in Europe include expanding the definition of permanent establishment to include \"digital presence\" criteria, such as users, \"clicks,\" or other digital activities with origins in the local jurisdiction. The OECD has continued work in this area with its Task Force on the Digital Economy. The European Commission announced a digital tax package containing two proposals: expanding the definition of permanent establishment to include digital presence and imposing an interim tax on certain revenue from digital activities. However, these proposals have stalled due to disagreement among member states and questions as to their legality under EU law.\n\nCritics argue that DSTs arbitrarily target firms within the digital economy for alleged excessive profit shifting and that tax policies in many countries have recently changed or are scheduled to change, reducing incentives for profit shifting.

Commercial speech, which is subject to less protection than other speech, can be compelled through disclosure requirements without violating the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech. However, the precise nature of a court's analysis depends on the character of the disclosure requirement.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld some commercial disclosure requirements that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech, but if a disclosure provision regulates \"speech as speech,\" it may be subject to heightened scrutiny. The Court has suggested that in certain circumstances, disclosure requirements may be subject to strict scrutiny.\n\nThe report also discusses the history of commercial speech under the First Amendment and the different standards of review that have been applied to commercial disclosure requirements. The most lenient standard, as set out in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, applies to commercial disclosure requirements that only involve factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which services will be available. However, the application of this standard has been debated in lower courts.\n\nThe report concludes by noting that recent Supreme Court decisions suggest that the Court may be more closely reviewing commercial disclosure requirements and that lower courts may be more likely to strike down such provisions. Congress and federal agencies should be aware of this trend and develop a record with more evidence demonstrating a need for commercial disclosure requirements when considering adopting or reauthorizing them."]}

CAPTA requires governors to assure that states have laws or programs addressing the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or displaying withdrawal symptoms at birth. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) amended certain provisions of CAPTA related to substance-affected infants.\n\nSubstance-affected infants are those born exposed to opioids in-utero, and those born negatively affected or experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The rate of NAS (Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome) has increased significantly in recent years, with approximately 21,732 infants diagnosed in 2012. Health care providers are required to notify child protective services (CPS) about substance-affected infants under state policies and procedures.\n\nCPS agencies investigate reports of child abuse and neglect, including those related to substance-affected infants. During an investigation, social workers determine the nature, extent, and cause of abuse or neglect and identify the person responsible. If social workers find that an infant is at risk for harm or neglect, or that abuse or neglect occurred, the case is substantiated, and a case plan is developed.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has led to an increase in the number of substance-affected infants, putting them at risk for child abuse and neglect if adequate supports and services are not available.

The EFMP consists of three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support.\n\nIdentification and enrollment: Medical and educational personnel at each installation are responsible for identifying eligible family members with special medical or educational needs and enrolling them in the EFMP. Servicemembers are also required to self-identify when they learn a family member has a qualifying condition.\n\nAssignment coordination: Before finalizing a servicemember's assignment to a new location, DOD requires each Military Service to consider any family member's special needs during the process, including the availability of required medical and special educational services at a new location.\n\nFamily support: DOD requires each Military Service's EFMP to include a family support component, which helps families with special needs identify and gain access to programs and services at their current and proposed locations.\n\nThe Office of Special Needs (OSN) was established by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 to develop, implement, and oversee DOD's policy for families with special needs.

The project is divided into three major segments: observatory, ground, and launch. NASA and contractors Northrop Grumman and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy's Space Telescope Science Institute are developing the observatory segment, which includes the Optical Telescope Element, Integrated Science Instrument Module, spacecraft, sunshield, and cryocooler. The software is being developed to deploy and control various components and collect and transmit data back to Earth.\n\nJWST faces numerous risks and unforeseen technical challenges, which can often become apparent during integration and testing. To accommodate these challenges, projects reserve extra time and funds. Each JWST element and major subsystem has been allocated schedule and cost reserves. When an element or major subsystem exhausts its reserves, it may begin to affect reserves on other elements or major subsystems. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has issued procedures for cost and schedule reserves. In addition to cost reserves held by the project manager, management reserves are held by the contractors to manage program risks and address unanticipated cost increases.\n\nJWST's development has faced significant schedule delays and cost increases, resulting in replans in 2011 and 2018. Early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low levels of cost reserves, and poorly phased funding caused the delays and cost growth. NASA placed an $8 billion cap on the project's formulation and development costs in 2011 and rebaselined the project with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion.

In the 114th and 115th Congresses, child nutrition reauthorization efforts focused on issues related to the content and type of foods served in schools, such as nutritional quality and domestic sourcing.\n\nThe HHFKA introduced new nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, which required USDA to issue proposed regulations within one year and final regulations within 18 months. The nutrition standards increased the amount of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school meals and set limits on calories, sodium, and other nutrients. However, some schools faced challenges implementing these changes, including difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance, reduced participation, increased costs, and increased food waste.\n\nIn response to these challenges, USDA made several modifications to the nutrition standards, including removing weekly limits on grains and protein, allowing flavored milk in schools, and providing exemptions for whole grain and sodium requirements. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule that indefinitely changed these aspects of the standards starting in SY2019-2020.\n\nOther issues in child nutrition programs include the inclusion of frozen, dried, canned, and other types of fruits and vegetables in the FFVP, and the use of electronic food benefits (Summer EBT) to provide food assistance to children during the summer months.

The trustees set the overall plan policy, direct plan activities, and set benefit levels. The plan is primarily funded through employer contributions, which are negotiated through collective bargaining agreements and based on a dollar amount per hour worked by each employee covered by the agreement.\n\nThe trustees decide how the trust fund should be invested to meet the plan's objectives, but they can use investment managers to determine how the trust fund should be invested. The trust fund can be allocated among many different types of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, and the plan's funded percentage varies from year to year due to economic and demographic factors.\n\nThe report notes that CSPF was the subject of investigations by the IRS, DOL, and DOJ in the 1970s due to alleged fiduciary breaches under ERISA. The DOL investigation resulted in a consent decree in 1982 that remains in effect today, which provides measures to ensure the plan complies with ERISA requirements and prescribes roles for multiple parties in its administration.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges faced by multiemployer pension plans, including underfunding, investment risks, and the potential for employer withdrawals.

The Choice Program was funded separately from other VA community care programs and will sunset in June 2019.\n\nVA's contracts with the TPAs did not include a payment timeliness requirement for community provider claims. Instead, a non-enforceable goal of processing and paying clean claims within 30 days of receipt was established. From November 2014 through June 2018, VA's TPAs paid approximately 16 million clean claims under the Choice Program, with wide variation in the time taken to pay these claims, from 7 to 68 days.\n\nThree factors affected the timeliness of claim payments to community providers: VA's untimely payments of TPA invoices, Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement, and inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims. VA made untimely payments to its TPAs, which resulted in insufficient funds for community provider payments. Choice Program requirements, such as the medical documentation, timely filing, and authorization requirements, led to claim denials and longer processing times. Inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims contributed to errors and delays.\n\nTo address these issues, VA has taken steps to improve its ability to pay TPA invoices in a timely manner, such as negotiating contract modifications and transitioning to a new payment system.

WMATA is also implementing a track preventive maintenance program to improve rail system safety and reliability, focusing on electrical fires caused by cable and insulator defects and defects to the track itself.\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration (FTA) plays a role in WMATA activities by providing and directing the use of federal funds, overseeing safety, and requiring transit asset management. FTA regulations established a National Transit Asset Management System, and WMATA completed its Transit Asset Management plan in October 2018.\n\nWMATA expends its capital funds on a variety of capital assets, with the largest portion going to rail and bus vehicle fleet replacement, rehabilitation, and maintenance. From fiscal year 2011 through 2017, WMATA expended approximately $2.16 billion on rail and bus fleet projects. The agency also faces challenges in fully expenditing its capital budget each year due to contracting and scheduling issues, changing priorities, federal reimbursement restrictions, and unpredictable funding.\n\nWMATA's new capital planning process could facilitate better identification of capital investment needs and help the agency make sound investment decisions. However, it still needs to establish documented policies and procedures to guide the developed performance measures and assess capital project and program performance. Additionally, WMATA needs to develop a plan to obtain complete information about the inventory and condition of its assets."]}

The WTO was established in 1995, building on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was founded in 1947. The WTO's primary objectives include fostering international economic cooperation, stability, and prosperity through a more open, rules-based trading system.\n\nThe WTO has faced challenges in recent years, including intensified scrutiny of its effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization and its role in resolving trade disputes. The organization has struggled to reach consensus on issues such as agricultural subsidies, industrial goods tariffs, and intellectual property rights protection. It has also faced challenges in addressing newer trade barriers, such as digital trade restrictions and the role of state-owned enterprises in international commerce.\n\nThe WTO's future direction and key policy issues for Congress include the value of U.S. membership and leadership in the organization, potential new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings for WTO reforms and rulemaking, and the impact of potential WTO withdrawal on U.S. economic and foreign policy interests.\n\nThe WTO has undergone significant changes since its founding, including the establishment of the Uruguay Round in 1986, which led to the creation of the WTO as a legal international organization and a stronger dispute settlement mechanism.

{"samples": ["\nThe report outlines the steps required by executive branch agencies under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPIA), as amended by IPERA and IPERIA, to address improper payments in their programs. Agencies must identify susceptible programs, develop improper payment estimates, analyze root causes, and report results. IPERA also directs inspectors general to report on agency compliance with six criteria. Agencies use statistically valid or alternative sampling approaches to estimate improper payments, with some incorporating actual improper payment amounts. Data sampled varies by program and includes payments, claims, tax returns, and pay accounts. Agencies may use older data with OMB approval. Testing processes include steps to address eligibility, and some agencies reported limitations in their testing, such as not verifying servicemember eligibility for special pay or allowances in DOD's Military Pay program or not testing eligibility for OPM's Retirement program. The report highlights the importance of proper estimation of improper payments to understand the extent of the problem and develop effective corrective actions. Recommendations include OMB developing guidance on how agencies test to identify improper payments and clarifying the appropriate treatment of nonresponse cases during improper payment testing.

The Coast Guard's TAP implementation reflects its organizational structure, with TAP managers assigned to 13 installations overseen by the Health, Safety, and Work-Life Directorate. However, the Coast Guard lacks a current Commandant Instruction on TAP, making it challenging to ensure complete and reliable data on servicemembers' participation.\n\nThe Coast Guard's TAP data are not sufficiently reliable due to limitations with the data collection system. The current system lacks adequate controls to ensure data completeness and accuracy. The Coast Guard plans to adopt DOD's TAP-IT Enterprise System to improve data sharing and reliability.\n\nCoast Guard servicemembers face challenges in attending TAP classes due to remote locations, rapid separations, and late starts in the transition process. Commanders sometimes prevent participation by requiring servicemembers to return to duty or wait until close to their separation date.\n\nThe Coast Guard uses DOD's 85% VOW compliance goal as an informal benchmark for TAP performance but lacks a formal, measurable goal for participation rates. Establishing such a goal could enhance accountability and progress toward meeting federal requirements.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is recommended to:\n\n1. Issue an updated Commandant Instruction to improve TAP data reliability and completeness.\n2. Establish a formal performance goal for TAP participation rates.\n3. Monitor the timeliness of servicemembers' participation in TAP.\n4. Monitor requests to attend additional 2-day classes and attendance rates.\n5. Issue an updated Commandant Instruction defining personnel roles and responsibilities.\n6. Enable unit commanders to access TAP performance information.\n7.

{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the health effects of radiation exposure, focusing on the challenges of estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. The linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, is used by federal agencies, including EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA, to set dose limits and guidance levels for workers and the public. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which health effects from acute exposures, such as those experienced by Japanese atomic bomb survivors, can be extrapolated to a population regularly exposed to low-dose radiation.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, seven federal agencies collectively decreased their annual funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation by 48 percent, with DOE and NIH accounting for most of the funding. The report recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects. However, DOE did not agree with this recommendation, stating that other agencies also have legal mandates to research low-dose radiation exposure and that it would not be appropriate for DOE to lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration.\n\nThe report also mentions that NRC and NRC officials continue to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies\u2019 Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board, to use the linear no-threshold model. Federal regulations set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level in the National Academies\u2019 2006 report on radiation and human health for defining low-dose radiation. For example, NRC\u2019s annual dose limit for members of the public from operation of nuclear power plants is a hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose.\n\nFDA regulates the maximum radiation output of medical equipment instead of setting limits on the total amount of radiation exposure to patients. NRC applies the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), and NRC defines ALARA to mean making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below dose limits as is practical.

The CRA requires federal banking regulators to evaluate banks' performance in meeting local credit needs and issue performance ratings based on their activities within assessment areas. These ratings are used in regulatory decisions, such as charter applications and mergers.\n\nThe CRA applies to banks with FDIC-insured deposits and includes national banks, savings associations, and state-chartered commercial and savings banks. It does not apply to credit unions, insurance companies, securities companies, and other nonbank institutions due to their different business models.\n\nThe CRA examination includes three tests: lending, investment, and service. The lending test evaluates mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer loans, while the investment test assesses community development investments. The service test examines retail service delivery. Banks receive more points for lending activities than for investments or services.\n\nThe CRA has been debated for its impact on lending activity. Some argue it may discourage banks from lending in non-targeted neighborhoods or encourage risky lending to higher-risk borrowers. However, others believe it has not been stringently enforced, as almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings.\n\nRecent policy discussions have focused on modernizing the CRA. Proposed changes include clearer standards for CRA-qualifying activities, increasing the timeliness of examinations, and incorporating performance incentives.

{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the historical background and legal framework of emergency powers in the United States, from the Continental Congress to the present day. The President has various powers to respond to crises or emergencies, some derived from the Constitution and others from statutory law. These powers have evolved over time, with some authorities becoming more circumscribed and regulated through the National Emergencies Act.\n\nThe report traces the origins of emergency powers to the Continental Congress, which passed acts and resolves dealing with the prosecution of the Revolutionary War. The Constitution failed to attract much attention to emergency powers during the debates at the Constitutional Convention. However, the granting of emergency powers by Congress is implicit in its authority to provide for the common defense and general welfare, the commerce clause, its war, armed forces, and militia powers, and the \"necessary and proper\" clause.\n\nThe report also discusses the views of classical political theorists, such as John Locke, who argued for a government of laws and not of men and recognized the need for the executive to exercise a broad discretion in meeting special exigencies or emergencies. The first expressions of emergency authority in the United States were during the Revolutionary War, and emergency powers have been invoked throughout American history, including during the Civil War, World War I, and the Great Depression.\n\nThe report notes that the extent of emergency powers' invocation and use is contingent upon the personal conception of the President of the presidency and the premises upon which they interpret their legal powers. The President may exercise certain powers in response to a national emergency, whether derived from legal sources or not, and may rely on constitutional authority or congressional delegations to do so.\n\nThe report concludes by discussing the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which established formal procedures for invoking and regulating emergency authorities. Since its enactment, various national emergencies have been declared, some of which have been revoked, and others remain in effect. The report suggests that further improvements and reforms in this policy area might be pursued and perfected."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) has seen significant growth in its competitive products sector, with volume increasing from 750 million pieces in fiscal year 2008 to 4.9 billion pieces in fiscal year 2017. Revenue from these products grew from 10 percent to 28 percent of all USPS mail revenues during the same period. USPS attributes this growth to the rise of e-commerce and the increasing demand for last-mile delivery services. In fiscal year 2017, competitive product revenue exceeded expectations by $500 million due to e-commerce growth and successful marketing campaigns. However, USPS faces competition in the first- and last-mile delivery services from other providers.\n\nTo remain competitive, USPS uses real-time visibility and accurate delivery time estimates for its competitive products, which are gained through scanning. Scanning information is also used to optimize USPS's network and streamline operations. USPS delivers competitive products across the nation, which is divided into seven postal areas comprised of 67 postal districts. Managers at each level are responsible for overseeing and reporting on the performance of the level below them.\n\nTo track the movement of competitive products, USPS uses automation and scan technology to capture barcode information. Competitive products could be scanned up to 13 times throughout the delivery process. USPS reports indicate that competitive products are almost always scanned and scanned correctly. However, missed and inaccurate scans do occur, which could potentially affect millions of competitive products.\n\nInstances of missed or inaccurate scans have been attributed to post office personnel not following proper scanning procedures and post office supervisors not adequately monitoring how scanning procedures are implemented. USPS has not based its operational policies and procedures on any standards for internal controls. The COSO Framework and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government are two widely used standards for designing, implementing, and maintaining an effective internal-control system.

WFIRST, an observatory designed to study the universe and planets beyond our solar system, is in the earliest stages of the acquisition life cycle with preliminary cost estimates ranging from $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion. TESS, a project to survey the sky for transiting exoplanets, has a latest cost estimate of approximately $337 million and is targeted to launch in March 2018. JWST, with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion, is one of NASA's most complex projects and top priorities. It is expected to help understand the origin and destiny of the universe and the creation and evolution of stars and planetary systems. JWST has experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays, with cost estimates ranging from $1 billion to $3.5 billion and expected launch dates ranging from 2007 to 2011. Following an independent review in 2010, Congress placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs for the project, and NASA rebaselined JWST with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion and a planned launch in October 2018. NASA's current portfolio of major space telescopes faces challenges in execution, including unforeseen challenges during integration and test, which can affect cost and schedule.

The SBA guarantees individual contracts up to $6.5 million and up to $10 million with federal certification. The program represents a small percentage (1.1% to 6.7%) of the total value of surety bonds issued by the private sector.\n\nThe SBA's guarantee ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. The program is designed to reduce the risk of contracting and encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses.\n\nThe SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has undergone several changes since its inception, including the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with a Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) in 1988, which initially provided SBA-approved sureties a lower guarantee rate in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed bonds without the SBA's prior approval. The program has also experienced fluctuations in demand and funding, with periods of growth and decline.\n\nCurrently, the program's eligibility standards and requirements include the business meeting the SBA's size standard for the primary industry, the bond being required, the applicant being unable to obtain the bond on reasonable terms and conditions without the guarantee, and a reasonable expectation that the applicant will perform the contract's terms and conditions. The applicant must also possess good character and reputation and not be debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or voluntarily excluded from transactions with any federal department or agency.\n\nThe SBA does not charge principals application or bid bond guarantee fees but requires them to pay a contractor fee equal to a percentage of the contract amount if"]}

In fiscal year 2017, there were approximately 25,700 beneficiaries receiving benefits, with an average annual cost for medical treatment being around $6,980 per miner. The number of beneficiaries has decreased due to declining coal mining employment and an aging population, but could increase due to the rising occurrence of black lung disease, particularly among Appalachian coal miners. Black lung claims are processed and adjudicated by the Department of Labor, with interim benefits paid from the Trust Fund during the appeals process. The Trust Fund's revenue is primarily obtained from the coal tax, which is imposed at different rates for underground and surface mines. In fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund had an approval rate of about 29 percent for black lung claims, with 64 percent of primary beneficiaries being paid from the Trust Fund, 25 percent from liable mine operators, and 11 percent receiving interim benefits.\n\nThe Trust Fund has faced financial challenges since its establishment, with expenditures consistently exceeding revenue, leading to the accrual of debt. From fiscal years 1979 through 1989, the Trust Fund borrowed heavily from the Treasury's general fund to cover the annual differences between its expenditures and revenues, resulting in a debt of over $3 billion by fiscal year 1989. Since fiscal year 1990, revenue has generally exceeded expenditures, but interest payments on the Trust Fund's outstanding debt have kept the fund in a position where its total expenditures continued to exceed its total revenues.

PAMA replaced the 57 separate fee schedules with a single national fee schedule based on private-payer rates. For individual tests, Medicare now pays the lesser of the amount claimed, the private-payer rate, or the national limitation amount. For panel tests without billing codes, Medicare pays separate rates for each component test instead of bundled rates. For panel tests with billing codes, Medicare pays the bundled rate if the laboratory uses the associated billing code, but individual rates if the laboratory lists each component test separately. The report also discusses the impact of these changes on various types of laboratories and the importance of complete data collection from laboratories to set accurate Medicare payment rates. The report estimates that Medicare expenditures on laboratory tests will be $733 million higher from 2018 through 2020 due to the use of national limitation amounts instead of actual payment rates as a starting point for payment-rate reductions. The report recommends that CMS take steps to collect all data from laboratories required to report, phase in payment-rate reductions from actual payment rates, use bundled rates for panel tests, and seek legislative authority if necessary."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe banking industry plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, facilitating investment and providing financial services to individuals and businesses. Bank regulation is a subject of ongoing political interest, with regulations generally falling into three categories: safety-and-soundness, consumer protection, and reporting requirements. The division of regulatory authority between the federal government and states significantly impacts the content of these regulations.\n\nFederal preemption is a key issue in bank regulation debates. It is the doctrine that allows federal law to supersede state law in certain areas. The Supreme Court has identified two ways federal law can preempt state law: expressly, when a federal statute explicitly states that it preempts state law, and impliedly, when federal law's structure and purpose make it clear that Congress intended to displace state law.\n\nThe American banking system has historically been a \"dual banking system,\" with both federal and state governments chartering and regulating banks. The dual system came about after the demise of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, leading to a period of state-chartered \"Free Banking.\" The Free Banking era lacked a uniform national currency and was marked by economic instability and high bank failure rates.\n\nIn response, Congress enacted the National Currency Act and the National Bank Act in 1863 and 1864, respectively. These acts created a \"dual banking system\" where both federal and state governments chartered and regulated banks. National banks were granted certain powers, such as the ability to issue national banknotes, and were subject to federal regulation.\n\nThe OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks and has broad powers to regulate their organization, examination, and operations. State banking authorities are the primary regulators of state-chartered banks. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC also play important roles in the bank regulatory regime.\n\nFederal preemption confers certain benefits on national banks, such as the ability to engage in specific activities without state interference. However, it also raises concerns about the potential for unequal regulatory treatment between national and state banks.\n\nCurrent issues in banking preemption include the extent to which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws, the OCC's decision to grant special purpose national bank charters to financial technology (FinTech) companies, and proposals to"]}

Congress faces several issues regarding the program, including approving or modifying the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request, determining the number of oilers needed to support Navy operations, and encouraging the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment.\n\nFleet oilers are essential to the Navy's ability to operate in forward-deployed areas by transferring fuel and other supplies to Navy surface ships, extending their endurance. The Navy's existing fleet of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class oilers, built between 1982 and 1989, will reach the end of their expected 35-year service life in 2021. The Navy plans to procure a total of 20 TAO-205s to maintain its fleet's capabilities.\n\nThe Navy's FY2020 budget requests $1,057.9 million in procurement funding for the TAO-205 program, including $981.2 million for the fifth and sixth ships, $73.0 million in advance procurement funding, and $3.7 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding. Congress must consider whether to approve, reject, or modify this funding request.\n\nThe Navy's new operational concept, Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), could lead to increased requirements for combat logistics ships, including oilers. The Navy is reviewing the potential growth in logistics requirements and the need to recapitalize the auxiliary and sealift fleet to support DMO.\n\nAnother issue for Congress is whether to encourage the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned. During the Cold War, underway replenishment ships were equipped differently depending on their role in the two-stage approach to underway replenishment. With renewed great power competition, the question is whether TAO-205s should be equipped with lesser or greater amounts of ship"]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report provides an overview of the three service classifications in the federal government: competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). The competitive service consists of most civil service positions in the executive branch, except for those specifically excepted or in the SES. Applicants for competitive service positions undergo practical examinations to test their relative capacity and fitness, and are eligible for appointment if they meet the minimum requirements and score 70 or higher. The competitive service includes various types of appointments, including continuing, term, and temporary, and employees are generally paid according to the General Schedule.\n\nThe excepted service includes civil service positions not in the competitive service or SES, and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM determines which positions to exempt based on impracticability or the need to recruit students or recent graduates through alternate methods. The excepted service includes four schedules, with schedule A positions not requiring competitive examination and schedule D positions requiring basic qualification standards. Excepted service employees maintain the same notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions as those in the competitive service, but some may have different durational requirements.\n\nThe SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators, and includes managerial or supervisory positions above the GS-15 grade. SES members serve as intermediaries between top-level political appointees and career civil servants. The SES consists of career reserved and general positions, with career reserved positions requiring career appointees to shield certain roles from political influence. The SES pay structure is distinct, with pay rates based on individual performance or contribution to agency performance. The SES includes career, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees, and has distinct removal procedures.\n\nIn summary, the report outlines the three service classifications in the federal government, their central features, and notable differences.

{"samples": ["\nThis report provides background information and issues for Congress regarding China's actions in the South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS), with a focus on implications for U.S. strategic and policy interests. The report highlights China's island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands, its strengthening position in the SCS, and its disputes with neighboring countries over maritime territories. The report also discusses China's position on the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) dispute and its impact on U.S. naval operations.\n\nChina's actions in the SCS and ECS have raised concerns among U.S. observers, who see these disputes as engaging U.S. interests for strategic, political, and economic reasons. The U.S. has treaty allies in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, and U.S. security policies regarding Taiwan and Southeast Asian nations are at stake. Chinese bases in the SCS and forces operating from them could complicate U.S. military intervention in a crisis or conflict with China and Taiwan, fulfill U.S. obligations under defense treaties, and prevent the emergence of China as a regional hegemon.\n\nThe report also discusses the potential for China to challenge the principle of freedom of the seas, which could have broad implications for the U.S. and other countries around the world. The principle of freedom of the seas, also known as freedom of navigation, is a key element of the U.S.-led international order that has operated since World War II. It allows all nations to navigate and operate freely in international waters, including military ships and aircraft. China's actions in the SCS and ECS challenge this principle, potentially leading to a \"might makes right\" approach to international relations.\n\nThe report concludes by discussing recent incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace, including incidents in which Chinese ships and aircraft confronted and harassed U.S. naval ships and surveillance planes. The report also discusses China's increasing military presence in the region and its efforts to expand its influence through economic and diplomatic means.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the importance of the South China Sea and East China Sea to U.S. strategic and policy interests and the need for a robust U.S. response to China's actions in the region"]}

Defense labs are managed within the military service chain of command and receive funding from a combination of sources, including mission funding, customer funding, and revolving funds. The Air Force and Army labs rely on appropriated funding, while Navy research and development activities operate under the Navy Working Capital Fund.\n\nThe report highlights four legislative authorities that have been instrumental in fostering innovation and efficiency within DOD labs: Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, Direct Hire Authority, and Micro-purchase Authority. These authorities provide lab directors with the flexibility to fund projects, propose alternative and innovative methods for lab management, directly hire personnel, and expand critical science and technology purchases using simplified acquisition methods.\n\nThe report also discusses the governance models used by selected DOD-sponsored federally funded research centers (FFRDCs) and university affiliated research centers (UARCs), as well as non-defense labs at the Department of Energy (Energy) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\nThe Laboratory Initiated Research Authority allows lab directors to fund projects in four allowable categories: basic and applied research, technology transition, workforce development, and revitalization, recapitalization, or repair or minor military construction of lab infrastructure. The Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program enables lab directors to propose alternative and innovative methods for lab management and operations. Direct Hire Authority provides a streamlined and accelerated hiring process for labs to compete with private industry and academia for high-quality scientific, engineering, and technician talent. Micro-purchase Authority facilitates the purchasing process for labs by allowing them to use simplified acquisition methods for critical science and technology purchases.\n\nThe report also identifies potential barriers that impede the use of these authorities, including DOD legal and policy restrictions and stakeholder concerns.

The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program, administered by the Department of Labor, provides unemployment benefits to individuals who have lost their jobs due to a major disaster. The dislocated worker program helps fund training and related assistance to dislocated workers, and Disaster Relief Employment Assistance grants can be used to employ dislocated workers in temporary jobs related to disaster recovery.\n\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) offers disaster loans to individuals and businesses affected by a disaster, with loan amounts up to $2 million and terms extending for up to 30 years. The Community Disaster Loan program provides loans to local governments suffering substantial loss of tax and other revenue due to a disaster. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund offers compensation for economic damages resulting from an oil spill.\n\nOther programs mentioned in the report include the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program, which provides grants for cost-effective hazard mitigation activities, and the Flood Insurance and Mitigation Administration's National Flood Insurance Program, which offers flood insurance and encourages property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance as a protection against flood losses.\n\nThe report concludes by noting that there are various general assistance programs that may be useful in disaster situations, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, job training, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Federal agencies may also offer assistance to state and local governments, and Congress may provide additional funds through emergency supplemental appropriations for certain general assistance programs specifically for use after a disaster.\n\nFor more information on these programs and other disaster assistance programs, congressional users are encouraged to contact the appropriate CRS program analysts or department or agency program officers.

{"samples": ["\nThe report outlines the process by which states report Medicaid expenditures to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the federal matching funds they receive. States must report expenditures quarterly on the CMS-64 form within 30 days of the end of each quarter, and can adjust past reporting for up to 2 years. Expenditures reported after the 2-year limit are generally not eligible for a federal match, with exceptions. The CMS-64 captures expenditure data for various aspects of states' Medicaid programs, including different types of services, populations, and federal matching rates.\n\nStates' reporting may vary depending on their Medicaid program features, such as expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act or waivers. CMS is responsible for ensuring that reported expenditures are supported and allowable. Regional offices perform ongoing oversight, with enhanced oversight procedures in high-expenditure states.\n\nDuring quarterly reviews, regional office reviewers have 50 days to review expenditures and compute the federal share of states' Medicaid expenditures. They also check that expenditures receive the correct matching rate. The amount of federal funds states receive for Medicaid services is determined annually by a statutory formula, but there are exceptions for certain types of beneficiaries, services, or administrative costs.\n\nWhen CMS identifies questionable expenditures or errors, there are several ways they can be resolved, including deferral of federal funds, state reducing reported expenditures, or disallowance of expenditures. CMS uses a variety of processes to assure that state-reported expenditures are supported during quarterly reviews and performs focused financial management reviews on expenditures considered at risk of not complying with Medicaid requirements.\n\nThe report found that CMS was identifying errors and compliance issues using both review methods but identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its oversight resources to address risks. CMS uses quarterly reviews to assess whether expenditures are supported by state accounting systems, in accordance with CMS approved methodologies, plans, and spending caps, and whether there are significant unexplained variances. Review procedures include validation measures that check to ensure that expenditures were reported within the 2-year limit and compare expenditures to various approval documents.\n\nRegional"]}
{"samples": ["\nEgypt has experienced a tumultuous political landscape since the overthrow of the British-backed monarchy in 1952, with the military producing four presidents: Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, and Abdel Fattah el Sisi. The only significant departure from military rule came between 2011 and 2013, when the Muslim Brotherhood's Muhammad Morsi was elected president following the Arab Spring protests. However, his rule was short-lived as the military, led by Defense Minister Sisi, reasserted control in 2013, suspending the constitution and installing an interim president. The Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters declared this a coup d'etat and protests ensued, resulting in the deaths of over 1,150 demonstrators.\n\nSince then, Egypt has been ruled by President Sisi, who has consolidated power amid a continuing economic recovery. Egypt is poised to play an increasingly active role in the region, albeit from a more independent position vis-a-vis the United States. While Egyptian relations with the Trump Administration are solid, Egypt has other significant partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France. The Egyptian government has proposed constitutional amendments that, if approved, would extend presidential term limits and executive branch control over the judiciary, giving President Sisi unprecedented power.\n\nEgypt's economy is recovering, with a projected 5.3% GDP growth in 2019, driven by an expansion in tourism and natural gas production. However, Egyptians continue to endure double-digit inflation and high unemployment, despite the government's efforts to reduce debt in compliance with IMF-mandated reforms. The state has enacted a series of austerity measures, including the depreciation of the currency, reductions in food and fuel subsidies, and the implementation of a value-added tax. Egypt's energy sector is also contributing to the economy's rebound, with the country being the largest oil producer in Africa outside of OPEC and the third-largest natural gas producer on the continent.\n\nDespite the positive economic outlook, significant challenges remain, including high inflation, public debt, and structural impediments to growth.

{"samples": ["\nThe report by the government agency discusses the use of commercially hosted payloads (CHPs) in the defense industry. CHPs refer to instruments or packages of equipment integrated onto a host satellite, making use of the host satellite's resources. Civil government agencies, such as NASA and NOAA, have used or plan to use CHPs for cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and continual technology upgrades. CHPs can save costs by having the government payload owner pay for a portion of the satellite development and shared launch and ground systems costs. They can also achieve faster on-orbit capability due to commercial satellites' relatively frequent launches and quicker development timelines.\n\nThe report highlights the benefits of using CHPs, including cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and continual technology upgrades. The use of CHPs can save costs by having the government payload owner pay for a portion of the satellite development and shared launch and ground systems costs. They can also achieve faster on-orbit capability due to commercial satellites' relatively frequent launches and quicker development timelines. Additionally, distributing capabilities across more satellites can increase deterrence and resilience by making it more difficult for adversaries to decide which assets to attack and increasing the ability to reconstitute satellite groups more quickly in case of unexpected losses.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges of matching a DOD payload with a commercial host satellite, including size, weight, power, spectrum needs, and alignment of government and commercial timelines. The report suggests that these challenges can be mitigated through the use of various expertise and lessons learned. For example, the HPO is developing a hosted payload interface unit that could potentially provide a standard for payload developers and system integrators to develop and test their systems. Additionally, with sufficient planning and time for system integration, nearly any payload can be accommodated on a host satellite.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the importance of centralized collection and assessment of agency-wide data on commercially hosted payloads to help mitigate the logistical challenges inherent in matching payloads to hosts and make reasoned, evidence-based decisions on whether a hosted payload would be a viable solution to meet warfighter needs. The Secretary of Defense is recommended to require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office"]}

The Omaha donor group proposed constructing an ambulatory care center using the existing $56 million appropriation and additional donations. The CHIP-IN Act authorized five pilot projects and placed certain requirements on donations, such as having already received appropriations for a VA facility project or being identified as a need in VA's long-range capital planning process.\n\nVA officials and the Omaha donor group entered into a donation agreement in April 2017 for the design and construction of an ambulatory care center. The facility will provide approximately 158,000 gross square feet of outpatient clinical functions and is scheduled for completion in summer 2020. The estimated project cost is approximately $86 million, with VA contributing $56 million and the Omaha donor group donating the remaining $30 million.\n\nSeveral VA offices are involved in the CHIP-IN pilot, including the Office of Construction and Facilities Management, the Veterans Health Administration, and the Office of General Counsel. While VA officials have not yet established clear, measurable objectives, assessment methodology, or evaluation plan for the pilot, they plan to do so as they formalize the CHIP-IN steering committee. The pilot presents an opportunity for VA to test a new way of building needed medical facilities using non-federal funding sources and has already shown potential benefits, such as cost and time savings and learning about private sector practices. However, without a strengthened pilot design, it may not be clear to VA and Congress whether the CHIP-IN approach could be part of a longer-term strategy or how lessons learned could enhance other VA construction efforts.\n\nTo address this, the Secretary of VA should ensure that internal stakeholders agree to and document clear, measurable objectives, develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan, and document the roles and responsibilities of CHIP-IN steering committee members and identify available staff resources."]}

The river's primary uses are agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial water supplies, with significant contributions to power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The federal government's role in basin management is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated facilities, which provide low-cost water and hydropower to water users.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin experiences highly variable precipitation and runoff, with natural flows averaging about 14.8 million acre-feet (MAF) annually but dipping significantly during the current drought, which began in 2000. Flows have averaged approximately 12.4 MAF per year since then, and climate change impacts may further increase the likelihood of prolonged drought.\n\nCongress plays a prominent role in the management of Colorado River water through funding and oversight of Reclamation's management of basin facilities, including facility operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. Congress has also approved and continues to consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters and development of new and expanded water storage in the basin.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922, signed by all but one basin state, established a framework for apportioning water supplies between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin, with the Upper Basin receiving 51.75% of any Upper Basin flows after Colorado River Compact obligations to the Lower Basin have been met.

The SFSP is administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the federal level and by state agencies and locally operated sponsors at the state level. Meals served under the SFSP must meet certain requirements to be eligible for federal reimbursement.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2007 to 2016, federal expenditures on the SFSP increased, with a slight decrease between fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The program allows for different types of meal sites, including open sites, closed enrolled sites, and camps. Open sites serve meals to all children in the area, while closed enrolled sites are open only to enrolled children. Camps are reimbursed only for meals served to children who have been individually determined to be eligible for free or reduced-price school meals.\n\nIn 2017, the federal reimbursement rate for each eligible SFSP lunch or supper served was $3.83 or $3.77, depending on the type of meal site. Each site may serve up to two meals or one meal and one snack per day. The SFSP also provides for certain flexibilities under its waiver and demonstration authorities.\n\nThe total number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer increased from 113 million in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million in fiscal year 2016.

CMS manages its fraud risks as part of a broader program-integrity approach, collaborating with contractors, health-insurance plans, and law-enforcement agencies to address fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\nThe Fraud Risk Framework, established by the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, provides a comprehensive set of leading practices for managing fraud risks in a strategic, risk-based way. The framework consists of four components: commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt. CMS has demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity, the Center for Program Integrity (CPI), to lead antifraud efforts and promoting an antifraud culture at all levels of the agency. However, CMS has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Fraud Risk Framework.\n\nThe assess component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for regular fraud risk assessments to determine a fraud risk profile. CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, but has not conducted a comprehensive fraud risk assessment for Medicare as a whole. Such an assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS plans to start a fraud risk assessment for Medicare after it completes a separate assessment of the federally facilitated marketplace.\n\nThe design and implement component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for the development and implementation of a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks. CMS has some control activities in place to identify fraud risk in Medicare, particularly in the FFS program, but has not developed and documented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare"]}

{"samples": ["\nThe federal government collects user fees from businesses and households for various services and regulatory activities. User fees accounted for $331 billion in FY2017, about a tenth of total federal receipts. Fees are voluntary and can help decentralize decision-making by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. However, they may not reflect economic conditions consistently and can bypass regular congressional scrutiny. User fees apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients, such as national park entry fees, passport application fees, and securities filings. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines user charges to include transactions not normally considered fees, such as land or asset sales. User fees can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on their authorization. Some federal agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), are wholly or partially funded by user fees and other nontax receipts. The economic suitability of user fees depends on whether the publicly provided benefit has meaningful spillover effects. For example, benefits generated by governments such as national defense or support for basic research are widely shared and thus, appropriately supported by general taxation. However, for other goods and services, user fees can help limit negative spillovers and increase economic efficiency by charging those who directly benefit for the costs of providing those benefits. The proper boundaries between public, private, and nonprofit sectors are an ongoing concern of policymakers, and the use of user fees and charges can affect those boundaries. Conflicts between executive branch agencies and Congress over funding and fiscal prerogatives are long-standing, and proposals to change the budgetary treatment of user fees could add new pressures on the congressional appropriations process."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe U.S. Constitution does not explicitly outline how military bases should be managed, leading to a shared responsibility between the President and Congress. The President, as commander-in-chief, has historically held broad authority to open, close, or realign military installations. However, Congress, through annual authorization and appropriation legislation, has the power to legislate policy for managing Department of Defense (DOD) real property assets and fund the construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal of military infrastructure.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Congress passed the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-82), which effectively halted the President's ability to close or realign major military installations without congressional approval. This legislation, codified as 10 U.S.C. 2687, required DOD to conduct comprehensive assessments as part of a report-and-wait process, which could be challenged in court.\n\nIn response to congressional pressure to accommodate DOD basing priorities, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process was established in 1988. This process, which has been modified in subsequent rounds in 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005, entrusts an independent commission with certifying closure and realignment recommendations made by the Secretary of Defense. The process requires the Secretary to submit a list of military installations recommended for closure or realignment to the commission, which may accept, reject, or modify the list. Upon completion of its review, the commission forwards its final findings and recommendations to the President, who then submits them to Congress. If the President does not submit the recommendations to Congress within the required timeframe, the BRAC process is terminated. Congress has the opportunity to disapprove of the recommendations in their entirety through the enactment of a joint resolution.\n\nThe BRAC process is intended to insulate base closings from political interference and has been considered a success. However, the transfer and disposal of DOD real property following a BRAC round is a complex process that may extend for years beyond the initial six-year implementation window. The disposal may be delayed or affected by the participation of local communities and the degree to which environmental remediation by federal authorities is necessary.\n\nSince "]}

The state authorization and accreditation components of the triad were developed independently to address quality assurance and consumer protection, with the federal government relying on states and accrediting agencies to determine educational program quality.\n\nInstitutions must meet various requirements to participate in Title IV programs, including offering at least one eligible program, state authorization, accreditation, and certification by ED. Proprietary institutions must also meet additional criteria, such as providing an eligible program of training for gainful employment or offering a bachelor's degree in liberal arts.\n\nInstitutions must also comply with regulations related to program participation agreements, campus safety policies and crime reporting under the Clery Act, the return of Title IV funds, and distance education. Failure to meet these requirements may result in additional oversight from ED and/or restrictions on Title IV participation.\n\nThe HEA defines IHEs as public or private nonprofit institutions that meet certain criteria, including offering a bachelor's degree or providing a program of at least two years that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree.

{"samples": ["\nThe Holman Rule is a long-standing House of Representatives rule that prohibits the inclusion of legislation changing existing law in general appropriations bills, except for retrenchments that reduce expenditures. The rule's origins can be traced back to 1835 when the House first recognized the need to separate policy debates from funding decisions. The rule was formalized in 1837, and over the years, it has been amended and interpreted to allow for specific types of retrenchments.\n\nThe rule was initially intended to prevent the inclusion of debatable matters in appropriations bills, but it has been construed to allow for amendments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials, the compensation of persons paid out of the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered by the bill. However, the rule does not apply to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill or to legislative language unaccompanied by a reduction of funds in the bill.\n\nThe Holman Rule has undergone several changes since its inception, with the most significant amendment occurring in 1983 when the exception was narrowed to apply only to retrenchments reducing amounts of money covered by the bill. In 2017, during the 115th Congress, a separate order was adopted to expand the exception to include retrenchments reducing the number and salary of officers or the compensation of persons paid out of the Treasury.\n\nDespite the rule's limitations, it has been used to allow for significant changes to federal programs and spending. For example, it has been used to allow for the consolidation or elimination of offices, the replacement of civilian employees with lower-paid military personnel, and the capping of salaries of certain employees. However, the rule does not allow for the inclusion of broad legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill or apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures.\n\nIt is important to note that the House Parliamentarian is the sole definitive authority on questions relating to the chamber's precedents and procedures and should be consulted for any formal opinion on specific parliamentary questions."]}

Runaway and homeless youth, including those in foster care, face numerous challenges such as untreated mental health disorders, drug use, sexual exploitation, and poor health. The report traces the history of federal efforts to support runaway and homeless youth, beginning with the Runaway Youth Act of 1974, which authorized funding for three programs: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Together, these programs make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF).\n\nThe BCP provides funding for community-based organizations to offer crisis intervention, temporary shelter, counseling, family unification, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2016, over 31,000 youth participated in the program. The TLP supports community-based organizations that provide longer-term residential services to homeless youth ages 16 through 22, including counseling, educational advancement, job attainment skills, and physical and mental health care. In FY2016, over 6,000 youth participated in the program. The SOP provides funding for community-based organizations to conduct street-based outreach and education, including treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to or are at risk of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, prostitution, and trafficking. In FY2016, SOP grantees made contact with over 36,000 youth.\n\nThe report also discusses the lack of a standardized methodology for counting the homeless and runaway youth population and the challenges of collecting accurate data.

Absent any policy changes, revenues are likely to be insufficient to maintain current levels of services.\n\nThe report also estimates a fiscal gap of about 14.7 percent of total expenditures or about 2.4 percent of GDP, which would require significant reductions in expenditures or increases in revenues to close. The long-term fiscal challenges are driven largely by health care expenditures, which are projected to increase from about 4.1 percent of GDP in 2018 to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2067. Medicaid spending, in particular, is expected to grow faster than GDP due to an increase in both enrollment and per capita costs.\n\nThe report also discusses the potential impact of recent policy changes, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, on the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. The simulations suggest that maintaining the operating balance at or above zero would require the sector to spend about 14.7 percent less than it would spend under current policies.\n\nThe report was prepared using data from various sources, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Congressional Budget Office.

For fiscal year 2017, DOD adjusted its methodology to calculate a 6-month average of exchange rates, which more closely represented foreign currency exchange rates experienced during budget formulation and accounted for the strength of the U.S. Dollar.\n\nDOD uses the International Treasury Services (ITS.gov) system to make foreign currency transactions, which offers advanced rates and the spot rate. The spot rate is the most cost-effective option but requires immediate transaction processing, while advanced rates are higher but offer certainty. Differences between obligations incurred at the foreign currency budget rates and the amounts disbursed drive gains or losses in the appropriated amounts DOD has available for overseas expenditures.\n\nThe Foreign Currency Fluctuations Defense (FCFD) account is used to maintain the budgeted level of operations in the MILPERS and O&M appropriation accounts by mitigating substantial gains or losses caused by foreign currency rate fluctuations. The FCFD account is different from the O&M and MILPERS appropriations in that it is a no-year account, meaning that it is available until expended, while the other appropriations are 1-year accounts that expire at the end of the fiscal year.

The program aims to identify and secure high-risk chemical facilities. The report highlights several areas of concern, including the process for identifying high-risk facilities, assessing risk and prioritizing facilities, reviewing and approving facility security plans, conducting facility compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach.\n\nOne significant finding was that over 1,300 facilities had failed to report holding ammonium nitrate to DHS, as required by the CFATS program. The report recommended that DHS work with other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to improve data sharing and identify potentially noncompliant facilities. DHS has since taken action to address this issue, identifying about 1,000 additional facilities and contacting them to ensure compliance.\n\nAnother concern was the use of self-reported and unverified data by DHS to determine the risk categorization for facilities holding toxic chemicals. The report recommended that DHS develop a new Top-Screen to address errors in the Distance of Concern submitted by facilities and identify potentially miscategorized facilities. DHS has since implemented an updated Top-Screen and collected data from facilities to calculate the Distance of Concern itself.\n\nThe report also addressed DHS's risk assessment approach, which did not consider all elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. The report recommended that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk and conduct a peer review after doing so. DHS has made progress towards addressing this recommendation, working with Sandia National Laboratories to develop a model to estimate the economic consequences of a chemical attack and revising the CFATS threat, vulnerability, and consequence scoring methods.\n\nAdditionally, DHS has made progress in reviewing and approving facility security plans by reducing the time it takes to review these plans and eliminating the backlog of plans awaiting review.

Coal accounted for 17% of energy production and 30% of electricity production in 2016, with approximately 730 million tons mined domestically, 40% of which was produced on federal lands. Coal mining, particularly surface mining, can have significant land surface disturbance and water quality impacts.\n\nThe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977 regulates coal mining's surface effects and created the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to administer the act. SMCRA requires mine operators to obtain permits and financial assurances to ensure reclamation compliant with water quality standards. As of 2017, approximately $10.2 billion in financial assurances were held by OSMRE and states for coal mine reclamation.\n\nThe report highlights challenges in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation, including self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies. Self-bonding allows operators to promise to pay for reclamation themselves, but it poses risks if the operator goes bankrupt or cannot meet the financial obligations. Unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term water treatment, may arise late in a mine's lifespan and exceed the operator's financial means.\n\nThe report recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation. This would help ensure that adequate funds are available to complete reclamation and prevent taxpayers from assuming the risk of paying for reclamation costs."]}

The Antideficiency Act generally prohibits the obligation or expenditure of federal funds without appropriations, leading to funding gaps that may result in a shutdown of affected projects and activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The report notes that there have been 20 funding gaps since FY1977, with the majority occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. The longest funding gaps, lasting between 8 days and 17 days, occurred before the issuance of Civiletti opinions in 1980, which clarified the limits of federal government activities during a funding gap.\n\nThe report also discusses the concept of an \"automatic continuing resolution\" (ACR) as a potential solution to funding gaps. An ACR would provide a fallback source of funding authority for activities in the event of disrupted timely enactment of appropriations. However, no permanent ACR legislation has been enacted into law.\n\nThe report provides detailed accounts of several funding gaps, including the two in FY1996, which resulted in widespread cessation of non-excepted activities and furlough of associated personnel. The report also discusses the legislative history of these funding gaps and the negotiations that led to their resolution.\n\nIn summary, the report highlights the challenges of funding the federal government annually and the impact of funding gaps on government operations.

{"samples": ["\nThe federal government owns and leases hundreds of thousands of buildings at a cost of billions annually. In response to long-standing issues with real property management, the executive branch, led by OMB and GSA, has taken steps to improve management through initiatives and memorandums. In 2012, OMB issued a memorandum freezing the federal government's real property footprint, followed by a clarification in 2013 that required agencies to maintain no more than their fiscal year 2012 total square footage of domestic office and warehouse space. In 2015, OMB transitioned from freezing to reducing the footprint, issuing the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property. The strategy outlined three key steps: freezing growth, measuring performance, and reducing the size of the inventory.\n\nAgencies reported strategies for reducing office and warehouse space in their annual Real Property Efficiency Plans. The most common methods were consolidation, co-location, disposal of unneeded space, better utilization of existing space, and teleworking and hoteling. Consolidation involved merging offices or operations, resulting in an average reduction of 1,800 square feet per project. Co-location allowed agencies to share common space, reducing rent and operating costs. Disposal of unneeded space was achieved by selling, demolishing buildings, or terminating leases. Better utilization of existing space was accomplished through the use of space utilization rates and capital planning processes. Teleworking and hoteling enabled agencies to eliminate dedicated offices for staff who primarily worked remotely, resulting in a 47% office space reduction for one program office.\n\nDespite these efforts, agencies faced challenges in achieving their space reduction targets. The most frequently cited challenges were space reduction costs, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. Space reduction costs included the up-front costs of relocations and tenant improvements.

{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the declining use of cash in the payment system and the potential implications of this trend. Cash continues to serve as money well in the United States, but electronic payment systems have become increasingly popular and cost-effective. Traditional electronic payment systems, such as credit and debit cards, and new systems, like mobile apps and point-of-sale hardware, are making cash less necessary for transactions. Newer digital currencies, like cryptocurrencies, offer alternative payment options that are independent from traditional systems.\n\nThe report examines the advantages and costs of each payment system and the potential obstacles to the adoption of alternative electronic payment systems. It also analyzes the potential consequences of a reduced role for cash in the economy, including potential benefits, such as improved efficiency and reduced crime, and potential costs, such as marginalizing people with limited access to the financial system and reducing personal privacy.\n\nThe report concludes that the role of cash in the payment system may continue to decline due to market preference or government policy. This trend could have significant implications for consumers, businesses, and society as a whole. Some observers argue that the elimination of cash would generate important benefits, such as improved efficiency, reduced crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Others argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattacks, and reduce personal privacy.\n\nThe report is divided into two parts. The first part analyzes cash and noncash payment systems and the potential outcomes if cash were to be significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment. The second part examines the potential implications of a reduced role for cash in the economy, including potential benefits, costs, and risks. The report also includes an Appendix that presents two international case studies of economies in which noncash payment systems rapidly expanded."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe Department of Energy operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs): Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). These agencies were established to market and sell electric power produced by federal dams and achieve small community and farm electrification. BPA, the oldest PMA, was created in 1937 and serves the Pacific Northwest, generating electricity from 31 federally owned hydropower facilities. It is self-financed and has permanent Treasury borrowing authority.\n\nSEPA, created in 1950, is the smallest PMA and contracts with other utilities for transmitting the federal power it markets to over 12 million consumers. It markets approximately 3,400 MW of power produced at 22 multipurpose water projects.\n\nSWPA, established in 1944, markets hydroelectric power in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas from 24 multipurpose Corps dams. It serves over 100 preference customer utilities with over 8 million end-use customers and manages nearly 1,400 miles of high-voltage transmission lines.\n\nWAPA, the newest and largest PMA, was created in 1977 and covers 1.3 million square miles, serving customers in 15 western states. It markets and transmits hydropower from 56 federal dams and sells hydropower produced by facilities administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission. WAPA also gives preference to Native American tribes for power sales.\n\nEach PMA faces unique challenges. BPA is addressing changing power generation and demand markets and the increasing competition from renewable energy sources. SEPA has an overcapacity issue due to projections for electricity load growth before the 2008 economic downturn. SWPA requires congressional authority to use its revenues from power sales over the long term due to its rain-based water supply and comparatively small reservoir system. WAPA is working to relieve transmission congestion within its marketing area and has implemented a drought-adder reduction program to help smooth annual differences in hydroelectric power generation.\n\nRecent proposals include the Trump Administration's plan to sell the transmission assets owned and"]}

The position is traditionally handed over to the Speaker-elect during the speakership election. The minority leader's primary goal is to recapture majority control of the House. The position is usually occupied by experienced lawmakers and is not well-defined in terms of duties.\n\nHistorically, the position of minority leader emerged during the latter part of the 19th century when strong partisan attachments, resilient patronage-based party organizations, and high levels of party voting in Congress made it conducive to the establishment of a more highly differentiated House leadership structure. The minority leader has formal and informal party responsibilities, including nominating party members to committees, appointing a leadership member to the Committee on the Budget, and handling a wide range of informal party assignments.\n\nMinority leaders are expected to be energetic and aggressive campaigners for party incumbents and challengers, and they employ various strategies to advance minority party objectives, such as cooperation, inconsequential opposition, withdrawal, innovation, and partisan opposition. They also engage in a range of activities to publicize their party's priorities and criticize those of the opposition, including holding joint news conferences with party colleagues, sponsoring town hall meetings, and creating theme teams.\n\nWhen the President and House majority are of the same party, the minority leader confers regularly with the President and his aides and acts as a national spokesperson for his or her party. Minority leaders also have certain institutional obligations associated with their position as a top House official, including attending meetings of the Intelligence Committee, appointing individuals to federal entities, and serving on various commissions and groups.\n\nThe minority leader faces real challenges in promoting and publicizing the party's priorities, serving the interests of rank-and-file Members, managing intraparty conflict, and forging party unity. The ultimate goal is to lead the party into majority status, but there is no set formula on how this is to be done. The minority party must decide how to respond when given only a small slice of the legislative pie, and the strategic challenge of minority party politics in the House of Representatives is how to overcome the limitation of inferior numbers."]}

IPA rotators are appointed through written agreements between NSF and their home institutions, which detail salaries and benefits. NSF reimburses cost-sharing amounts to home institutions, allowing them to continue paying rotators' full salaries and benefits. IPA rotators may receive salaries exceeding the federal maximum for their position at NSF, while VSEE rotators are appointed as federal employees on a nonpaid leave of absence from their home institutions. NSF sets salaries for VSEE rotators that are generally comparable to their salaries at home institutions, but caps their salaries at the federal maximum for their position. Both IPA and VSEE rotators are eligible for certain reimbursements, such as moving expenses and travel-related expenses for the Independent Research and Development program.\n\nRotators are primarily assigned to NSF's seven directorates, with most being IPA rotators used in both executive and program director positions, and VSEE rotators in program director positions. The proportion of rotators to other staff has remained relatively stable, with most rotators being IPA rotators. NSF officials stated that there is no similar steering committee for overseeing VSEE rotators, and each VSEE rotator is individually overseen by their respective supervisor.\n\nNSF's use of IPA rotators in executive positions has increased since fiscal year 2012, with about 33% of executive positions filled by IPA rotators in November 2017. IPA rotators in executive positions are responsible for setting the direction for their scientific area, leading scientific and technical matters, establishing an organizational culture, overseeing outreach and collaboration with NSF stakeholders, and contributing to NSF and national policy development and implementation.\n\nNSF implemented a cost-sharing pilot program in October 2016, requiring institutions to pay for at least 10% of IPA rotators' salaries and fringe benefits.

Prominent housing issues include ongoing debates on housing finance system reform, prioritizing appropriations for federal housing programs, oversight of program changes, and extending temporary housing-related tax provisions.\n\nBackground information on housing market conditions reveals rising house prices, relatively low interest rates, and increasing rental costs. House prices have been increasing since 2012, with year-over-year increases exceeding 5% for much of that time. Mortgage interest rates have remained low but have risen for certain periods. Despite these trends, housing affordability remains relatively stable due to rising incomes and low interest rates.\n\nThe housing market is closely linked to the mortgage market, with most homebuyers obtaining mortgages. Current trends in owner-occupied housing and mortgage market indicators include increasing house prices, low mortgage interest rates, and a higher number of renter households. The rental market has seen increased demand and lower vacancy rates, leading to higher rents.\n\nFederal housing programs, such as those administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), may be of interest to the 116th Congress. These programs include housing assistance, rental assistance, and housing finance. Ongoing issues include housing finance system reform, appropriations for federal housing programs, oversight of program changes, and extending temporary housing-related tax provisions.\n\nTwo major players in the U.S. housing finance system are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The potential for legislative housing finance reform, new leadership at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and certain issues affecting Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's finances and mortgage standards are of interest.\n\nIn a budget environment with limits on discretionary spending, the pressure to provide increased funding to maintain current services for existing rental assistance programs must be balanced against the pressure to maintain or increase funding for other popular programs.

{"samples": ["\nThe U.S. corporate income tax system, which taxes both domestic and foreign income, has led to complications for tax administration and compliance when corporations operate in multiple jurisdictions. Some corporations have used strategies like inversions to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities. The report discusses the history of inversions, the legislative responses, and the current state of inversions.\n\nInversions involve a U.S. corporation changing its country of residence by merging with a foreign parent corporation or by creating a foreign subsidiary and exchanging stock. The typical result is that the new foreign parent company faces a lower home country tax rate and no tax on its foreign-source income.\n\nThe American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) made it more difficult for corporations to invert by denying or restricting the tax benefits if the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the owners of the original company or if the firm did not have substantial business operations in the country where the new headquarters was located. However, some corporations have still managed to invert using the substantive business operations mechanism or by merging.\n\nIn 2014, several high-profile companies, including Pfizer, Chiquita, and Omnicom, expressed interest in merging or planning mergers with non-U.S. firms. The Treasury Department responded by releasing regulatory changes that restricted some aspects of inversions or their benefits. Some firms canceled their plans, but new merger proposals were also announced.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 made major changes to the corporate tax and international tax rules, including the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax, which taxes foreign source income of U.S. subsidiaries currently but with an exemption for a deemed return on tangible assets and a deduction from the remaining income. The TCJA also adopted the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (BEAT), which aims to address profit shifting between foreign parents and U.S. subsidiaries.\n\nDespite these changes, corporations may still consider inversions due to the potential tax savings. Policy options to prevent or limit inversions include extending the rate recapture, directly restricting the ability of U.S. firms to invert by merger, and adopting"]}

UN peacekeeping operations have evolved from primarily military missions to multidimensional operations that include civilian and police personnel. These multidimensional operations aim to create a secure and stable environment while working with national authorities to implement peace agreements. UN peacekeeping operations in sub-Saharan Africa, such as MINUSCA in the Central African Republic (CAR), are designed to protect civilians, support the implementation of political processes, promote human rights, and restore the rule of law.\n\nMINUSCA was established in 2014 in response to escalating violence in CAR, which resulted in thousands of deaths, internal displacement, and the need for humanitarian aid. MINUSCA's tasks include protecting civilians, supporting the implementation of the transition process, facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and supporting justice and the rule of law.\n\nThe UN reported that MINUSCA's approved personnel levels for UN fiscal year 2017 comprised 10,750 military personnel, 400 individual police officers, and 1,680 formed police unit personnel, as well as 790 international civilian and 696 national civilian personnel, 238 UN volunteers, and 40 government-provided personnel. The estimated cost of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in CAR was nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN cost for MINUSCA over the same time period.\n\nFactors contributing to the difference in costs include disparities in the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems. The UN relies on in-country or local infrastructure and equipment provided by troop-contributing countries, while the United States would airlift most of its supplies from outside CAR. The UN reimburses countries for deploying their equipment, while the United States would bear the additional cost of salaries for reservist military personnel and deploying active duty military personnel. The United States would also pay over $167 million for U.S. civilian police, while the UN spent $41 million on individual police officers.

The SBA defines a small business as one that is organized for profit, has a place of business in the US, operates primarily within the US, is independently owned and operated, and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The SBA uses two types of size standards to determine eligibility for its programs: industry-specific size standards and alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes.\n\nThe SBA's size standards have been challenged over the years, with industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and Members of Congress concerned that the size standards may not adequately target small businesses. In response, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the SBA to conduct a detailed review of its industry size standards every 18 months and ensure that each size standard is reviewed at least once every five years. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 directed the SBA not to limit the number of size standards and to assign the appropriate size standard to each NAICS industrial classification. The Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018 required federal agencies to use the average annual gross receipts from at least the previous five years when seeking SBA approval to establish a size standard based on annual gross receipts.\n\nAs of 2016, there were over 5.95 million employer firms and over 24.8 million nonemployer firms in the US. About 97% of all employer firms qualified as small, representing about 30% of industry receipts. The SBA generally prefers to use average annual receipts as a size measure but has historically used the number of employees to determine eligibility for manufacturing and mining companies. Before changing a size standard, the SBA conducts an analysis of the industry's overall degree of competition and the competitiveness of firms within the industry, focusing on average firm size, average asset size, the 4-firm concentration ratio, and size distribution of firms. The SBA also considers the ability of small businesses to compete for federal contracting opportunities and secondary factors as they are relevant to the industries and the interests of small businesses."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report provides an overview of retirement plans in the United States, focusing on defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) plans. Over the last three decades, employers have shifted from sponsoring DB plans to DC plans, transferring investment risk to employees. DC plans, such as 401(k) plans, offer individual accounts with benefits based on contributions and investment performance. The report discusses the portability of DC plans, potential early withdrawals, and tax incentives for retirement savings.\n\nIn 2016, there were 656,241 DC and 46,300 DB plans in the US. Employers can sponsor 401(k) plans, which allow participants to save pre-tax income and defer taxes until retirement. Employers decide on contribution amounts and vesting schedules. Individuals also have tax incentives to save for retirement outside of employer-sponsored plans through IRAs.\n\nIRAs were established to provide a way for individuals not covered by a pension plan to save for retirement and to give workers a way to preserve assets from 401(k) plans. In 2017, 34.8% of households owned an IRA, and IRA assets accounted for almost 33% of total US retirement assets.\n\nThe report discusses the importance of enforcing tax laws and ERISA provisions related to retirement plans. The IRS and DOL share responsibility for overseeing prohibited transactions and enforcing laws governing 401(k) plans.\n\nEmployers may allow participants to access their retirement savings prior to retirement through loans, hardship withdrawals, or cashouts. The report discusses the potential short-term and long-term impacts of early withdrawals on participants' ability to accumulate retirement savings.\n\nThe report also mentions the mobility of the workforce and the need for individuals to decide what to do with their retirement plan balances when they change jobs. Plan administrators must provide a tax notice detailing participants' options for handling their account balances.\n\nThe report concludes by recommending that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for EBSA, in coordination with the IRS, to revise the Form 5500 to require plan sponsors to report qualified plan loan offsets as a separate line item distinct from other types of distributions"]}

These complications include autonomic dysreflexia, depression, impaired bowel and bladder functioning, pressure ulcers, and spasticity. Spinal cord injuries can also result in acquired brain injuries, which can lead to changes in physical, behavioral, and cognitive functioning.\n\nMedicare payments for long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and acute care hospitals are structured differently, with LTCHs typically receiving higher payments due to the average resources required to treat patients who need long-term care. However, concerns have been raised about the growth in the number of LTCHs and the extent to which some of their patients may be appropriately treated in less costly settings.\n\nTwo LTCHs, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center, have been granted a temporary exception to site-neutral payments due to their specialized focus on treating spinal cord and brain injuries. Both hospitals have high volumes of patients with complex injuries and offer specialized programs and services, including interdisciplinary treatment teams, advanced medical management, and housing for families.\n\nThe report also discusses the differences in payment systems and data limitations that make it difficult to directly compare the attributes of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the two qualifying hospitals and IRFs. However, key similarities and differences between the qualifying hospitals and certain IRFs that provide specialty treatment for catastrophic spinal cord injuries, acquired brain injuries, or other paralyzing neuromuscular conditions were identified. These include volume of services, specialty accreditation and designation as model systems, specialized programs and services, staff with specialized training and clinical expertise, out-of-state admissions, ability to treat medically complex patients, and additional funding from philanthropic donor bases.\n\nThe report concludes by noting that both qualifying hospitals' LTCH status provides certain advantages over IRFs, such as the ability to admit some medically complex patients earlier in the recovery process and longer lengths of stay. However, IRFs also reported having the flexibility to admit some medically complex patients requiring more advanced level monitoring and resources earlier in the recovery process.

First issued by the Continental Congress in 1776, the tradition of creating individually struck gold medals has continued to the present day. Although there are no permanent statutory provisions for the creation of Congressional Gold Medals, Congress has authorized them on an ad hoc basis for various achievements, both military and civilian.\n\nInitially, Congressional Gold Medals were awarded primarily for military achievements during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. However, in 1854, the scope of activities meriting a gold medal was broadened to include nonmilitary heroic activities and specific fields. Notable recipients include George M. Cohan, the first entertainer to receive a gold medal, and Wilbur and Orville Wright, the first aeronautical pioneers.\n\nThe process for considering and authorizing a Congressional Gold Medal involves the introduction of legislation, typically referred to the House Committee on Financial Services or the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The procedures for considering this legislation vary between the House and Senate, with no formal chamber or committee rules regarding the process.\n\nOnce a bill is enacted, the Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for striking and selling duplicate medals in bronze. The duplicates are generally sold in two sizes and at a price that covers the cost of striking the gold medal.\n\nCongressional Gold Medal legislation typically includes findings that summarize the subject's history and importance, specifications for awarding the medal, instructions for the medal's design and striking, permission to mint and sell duplicates, and certification that medals are minted pursuant to existing requirements for national medals.\n\nAs Members of Congress consider introducing legislation to award a Congressional Gold Medal, they must decide whom or what to recognize and whether to specify design elements.

Cobra Dane, located at Shemya Island, contributes to ballistic missile defense by tracking and classifying missile threats, and can potentially determine if a threat was intercepted successfully in the future. Radar systems can also provide discrimination capabilities, allowing for the identification of warheads among decoys. In addition to its ballistic missile defense role, Cobra Dane can contribute to space surveillance, tracking small objects that no other radar system can. The Air Force, in coordination with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), is responsible for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, with U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command defining priorities for the overall radar infrastructure.\n\nThe report also discusses the planned deployment of the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear Air Force Station, which will provide real-time discrimination information for missile threats targeting Alaska and the continental United States, and will allow for cost savings and operational advantages compared to locating it at Shemya Island. Other radar investments, such as the Pacific Radar and Space Fence, may reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane for ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, respectively.\n\nThe Air Force reported that Cobra Dane had an average operational availability of 91% over a 2-year period, but this had declined to approximately 88% in a more recent 2-year period due to scheduled downtime and one instance of unscheduled downtime. The department can mitigate the effect on the ballistic missile defense mission by deploying the Sea-Based X-band radar to specific locations in the Pacific Ocean to provide additional tracking coverage of missile threats.\n\nThe Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of Cobra Dane, and for three modernization projects: mission system replacement, traveling wave tubes, and transmitter groups.

In 2010, the Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow public disposal of unused controlled substances through authorized entities. DEA regulations outline three methods for disposal: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Eligible entities, such as retail pharmacies and hospitals, must modify their DEA registration to become authorized collectors. DEA regulations require secure disposal bins, with specific requirements for installation, management, and destruction of collected substances. As of April 2017, about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered as authorized collectors, with most being pharmacies. Participation rates varied significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate and Connecticut, Missouri, and Maine having the lowest. Factors affecting participation include costs, uncertainty over regulations, and availability of alternative disposal methods. Costs include purchasing and installing disposal bins, ongoing management costs, and disposal fees. Uncertainty arises from regulations, such as the non-retrievable standard for destruction of inner liners, which stakeholders find unclear. Some entities may already be participating in alternative disposal methods, reducing the incentive to become authorized collectors.

Most suspension measures were bills, with 83% being House-originated and 11% being Senate-originated. The majority of suspension measures were sponsored by majority party members, but this procedure was also the most common way for minority-sponsored legislation to reach the floor.\n\nMeasures are typically referred to at least one House committee before consideration under suspension. In the 114th Congress, 96% of suspension measures had been previously referred to a House committee. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the largest number of suspension measures.\n\nSuspension motions require a two-thirds majority for passage, and debates are limited to 40 minutes.

The report explains that states primarily make decisions about election administration, while localities handle day-to-day implementation. The report also discusses how federal laws and funding have affected state and local systems, leading to both intended and unintended consequences.\n\nThe report highlights the decentralized nature of election administration in the U.S., with thousands of state and local systems responsible for conducting elections. It describes how states generally make decisions about election administration through their legislatures and constitutions, while localities implement these decisions. The report also notes that Congress has a role in influencing election administration policy through various tools, such as federal laws and funding.\n\nThe report uses examples from past federal actions, such as the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), to illustrate how the duties and structures of state and local election systems interact with federal activity. It explains that HAVA required states to designate a chief state election official and establish statewide voter registration lists, while also allowing localities to handle most of the day-to-day implementation of election administration policy.\n\nThe report also discusses the costs associated with election administration, noting that the federal government does not provide ongoing funding for state and local election administration. It explains that states and localities are primarily responsible for the costs of conducting federal elections, with some federal funding available through HAVA.\n\nThe report concludes by suggesting that Members considering changes to election administration may want to consider how any proposed change would interact with the duties and structures of state and local election systems, whether it would be difficult to implement given these structures, and whether it would have unintended consequences for state and local systems. The report also suggests that the nature of the state and local system may inform a proposed change, such as whether it is a federal requirement or federal funding, and who is responsible for compliance or implementation."]}

The report attributes the most significant reductions in crashes and fatalities to the closure or improvement of dangerous crossings between 1975 and 1985. The Section 130 Program, which provides funds to states for the elimination of hazards at highway-rail grade crossings, has been instrumental in these improvements. The program requires states to establish an implementation schedule for grade-crossing safety improvement projects, with at least 50% of funds dedicated to the installation of protective devices.\n\nThe report highlights the challenges states face in implementing and assessing grade-crossing safety projects, including the inability or unwillingness of local agencies to provide matching funds, the relatively low amount of funding designed to incentivize localities to close crossings, and the difficulties of using before-and-after crash statistics to measure effectiveness. The report recommends that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) evaluate the Section 130 Program's requirements to determine whether they allow states sufficient flexibility to adequately address current and emerging grade-crossing safety issues. The report also suggests that FHWA could consider changes to the types of projects eligible for funding under the Section 130 Program to better address emerging safety problems.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the importance of education and enforcement efforts in further improving safety, as well as the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of the Section 130 Program to better understand why crashes continue to occur and what types of projects may be effective. The report also notes that the continued number of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings with devices intended to warn of a train's presence calls into question whether the Section 130 Program is structured to help states continue making progress toward the national goal to reduce fatalities and injuries."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe Purple Heart, originally known as the Badge of Military Merit, is a military decoration awarded to servicemembers who have been wounded or killed in action. The history of the Purple Heart dates back to 1782 when George Washington created the Badge of Military Merit to recognize soldiers for meritorious actions. However, the award fell into disuse after the Revolutionary War. It was not until 1932 that the Purple Heart was revived by General Douglas MacArthur and redefined to focus on soldiers killed or wounded in combat.\n\nSince then, the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart have expanded several times. In 1942, the award was extended to Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard members serving in World War II. In 1952, Purple Hearts were retroactively awarded to World War I veterans of all services. In the 1960s, eligibility was expanded to include servicemembers engaged in armed conflict against an opposing military or hostile foreign force, and later to include military personnel and government civilians killed or wounded in international terrorist attacks or peacekeeping operations.\n\nRecent events, such as the shootings at Fort Hood and Little Rock, have prompted debate over whether terrorist attacks should be considered eligible for the Purple Heart. In 2015, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015, which expanded eligibility by redefining what should be considered an attack by a foreign terrorist organization. This allowed servicemembers wounded or killed in the Fort Hood and Little Rock shootings to receive the Purple Heart.\n\nHowever, some argue that awarding the Purple Heart for terrorist attacks sets a precedent for future subjectivity and could dilute the significance of the award. Others advocate for expanding eligibility to include mental conditions such as PTSD, which can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries. Currently, DOD does not consider servicemembers with PTSD eligible for the Purple Heart.\n\nMembers of Congress can request that a Service Secretary consider awarding military decorations, including the Purple Heart, to individuals or groups. The Secretary will review the proposal and determine whether the award warrants approval based on its merits.\n\nOverall, the"]}

SNAP regulations require states to determine applicant eligibility, issue benefits on Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards, and investigate potential program violations. SNAP recipients are subject to work requirements, including registering for work, reporting to employers, and participating in work programs or workfare. Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) are subject to additional work requirements and time limits.\n\nSNAP Error Rates and Improper Payments: In fiscal year 2014, $2.6 billion, or 3.66 percent, of all SNAP benefits paid were improper. Household income was the most common primary cause of dollar errors. States review the accuracy of SNAP payments and share responsibility with FNS for addressing fraud.\n\nSNAP Retailer Trafficking: FNS is responsible for authorizing and monitoring retailers, including investigating potential trafficking. Retailers must meet program requirements and are subject to penalties for trafficking. In 2016, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were work registrants, and about 0.5 percent participated in state SNAP Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) programs. From fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2016, the average monthly number of SNAP E&T participants decreased from about 256,000 to about 207,000, while the average monthly number of SNAP recipients increased from about 27.8 million to about 43.5 million.\n\nSNAP E&T Programs: States have flexibility in designing their SNAP E&T programs, which can be voluntary or mandatory. Voluntary programs allow states to focus on serving motivated participants, while mandatory programs may be less administratively burdensome but may not provide as robust employment and training services. FNS has encouraged states to provide more robust services through voluntary programs and has increased federal support for these programs.\n\nSNAP Fraud: FNS and states partner to address SNAP fraud, including eligibility fraud and retailer trafficking.

Approximately 50.3 million students were enrolled in over 98,000 public elementary and secondary schools in the 2014-2015 school year. Oversight of these schools is provided by approximately 16,000 local educational agencies (LEAs), which in turn are overseen by state educational agencies.\n\nLead is a neurotoxin that can have detrimental effects on the health of children and adults if ingested. The presence of lead in drinking water can cause health effects, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, and cardiovascular and reproductive problems. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set standards for drinking water contaminants, including lead.\n\nThe report discusses the various ways in which states and LEAs approach testing for lead in school drinking water. Some states establish charter schools as their own school district and oversee their testing and remediation, while others allow charter schools to be part of a larger district. Charter schools are often responsible for their own facilities and may lease or purchase non-traditional school buildings.\n\nState educational agencies are responsible for administering state and federal education laws, disbursing funds, and providing guidance to school districts and schools across the state. They frequently provide funds for capital improvements to school facilities, which can be used to address issues related to lead in school drinking water.\n\nThe report also discusses the health effects of lead exposure and the various ways in which it can enter drinking water. Lead typically enters school drinking water as a result of interaction with lead-containing plumbing materials and fixtures within the building.\n\nThe EPA's Lead and Copper Rule establishes maximum contaminant levels for lead in drinking water and requires water systems to take certain actions if these levels are exceeded. The report discusses the various ways in which states and LEAs have responded to the Lead and Copper Rule, including the implementation of testing and remediation programs.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of communication and collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies in addressing lead in school drinking water.

DOD was later granted these authorities in the FY1990 & 1991 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nOTs are legally binding contracts that are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations, such as the Competition in Contracting Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. They can be used for research, prototype projects, and follow-on production. DOD's OT authorities are found in sections 10 U.S.C. 2371 and 2371b.\n\nOTs offer benefits such as pooling R&D resources with industry, attracting nontraditional contractors, lowering costs, and speeding up the acquisition process. However, they also come with risks, including diminished oversight and exemption from laws and regulations designed to protect government and taxpayer interests.\n\nCongress has expressed concerns about the potential for OTs to be used to circumvent congressional intent and has mandated additional reporting and notification requirements. DOD lacks authoritative data on OT effectiveness and is taking steps to improve the data.\n\nIn FY2017, DOD obligated $2.1 billion on prototype OT agreements and received $360 million in cost-share contributions, representing less than 1% of DOD's total contract obligations.

{"samples": ["\nThe report examines the current legal landscape of data protection in the United States, contrasting the patchwork of federal laws with more comprehensive regulatory models in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The report highlights the need for federal legislation due to the fragmented legal landscape and concerns over existing laws' adequacy.\n\nHistorically, common law and constitutional protections have provided limited privacy safeguards for Americans. The Constitution's Bill of Rights protects individual privacy from government intrusion but offers little protection against non-governmental actors. Federal statutes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), regulate specific industries and types of data. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces federal prohibitions against unfair and deceptive data protection practices.\n\nThe report discusses the potential legal considerations for the 116th Congress in crafting more comprehensive federal data protection legislation. It also explores the evolution of privacy law in the United States, from the seminal article \"The Right to Privacy\" by Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren in 1890 to the current state of privacy torts and constitutional protections.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing the privacy and data protection challenges of the digital age, as Americans increasingly transmit personal data online at an exponential rate. It suggests that a more comprehensive federal data protection law could help ensure that individuals' privacy rights are adequately protected in the digital age."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report from the government agency evaluates the reliability of the Census Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census using the Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The Bureau's cost estimate was assessed against four characteristics: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. While the Bureau's cost estimate substantially met the criteria for comprehensive, accurate, and credible, it only partially met the criteria for well-documented.\n\nThe Bureau's cost estimate was found to be comprehensive as it included both government and contractor costs over the full life-cycle of the program, defined the program, reflected the current schedule, and was technically reasonable. The cost estimate was also accurate as it was based on an assessment of most likely costs, adjusted for inflation, and contained few errors. The estimate was credible as it discussed limitations of the analysis, varied major assumptions, and performed risk and uncertainty analysis.\n\nHowever, the documentation supporting the cost estimate was found to be inadequate in some areas. Source data did not always support the information described in the basis of estimate document, calculations were not always replicable, and some cost elements did not trace clearly to supporting spreadsheets and assumption documents.\n\nThe Bureau has made progress in addressing these issues and has established reliable guidance, processes, and policies for developing cost estimates and managing the cost estimation process. However, until the Bureau fully meets the criteria for being well-documented, the cost estimate cannot be considered fully reliable.\n\nThe report also compared the 2015 and 2017 life-cycle cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. The largest increases occurred in the Response, Managerial Contingency, and Census/Survey Engineering categories due to reduced assumptions for self-response rates, increased contingency allocations, and IT cost increases.\n\nOverall, the report concludes that while the Census Bureau has made significant progress in improving the reliability of its cost estimates, there is still work to be done to fully meet the criteria for a high-quality estimate. The Bureau's cost estimate is a critical tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census, and ensuring its reliability is essential for the success of the program."]}

These agencies' land acquisition and disposal authorities vary significantly. The NPS has limited authority to acquire or dispose of lands, while the BLM has relatively broad authority for both. The FS can acquire lands within or contiguous to national forest boundaries, but disposal is limited and infrequent. The FWS has no general authority to dispose of its lands.\n\nAcquisition authorities allow federal agencies to acquire lands for various reasons, such as improving management, conserving species, and increasing recreational opportunities. Disposal authorities enable agencies to dispose of lands no longer required for federal purposes or chiefly valuable for other uses.

The official manual of House rules is over 1,000 pages long, but gaining a fundamental understanding of the procedures is not as difficult as the size suggests. The House's ways of applying its rules are largely predictable, and the underlying premise is that a majority of Members should ultimately be able to work their will on the floor.\n\nThe Constitution grants the House broad authority to determine its own rules, allowing it to amend them unilaterally and suspend, waive, or ignore them as needed. Debate on the floor is limited, with each Member allowed to speak for only an hour on a question, and most measures are debated for no more than one hour before a vote. The House frequently considers legislation in the Committee of the Whole, a committee of the whole House, where more flexible procedures allow for extensive debate and amendment.\n\nMost bills are first referred to and considered in a standing legislative committee before coming to the floor. In Committee of the Whole, the Speaker appoints a chair from the majority party to preside during the consideration of a particular bill or resolution. The rules that apply in Committee of the Whole are somewhat different from those that govern meetings of the House itself, making the procedures in Committee of the Whole more flexible.\n\nThe House uses various modes of consideration to consider legislation, including suspension of the rules, which enables the House to act quickly on bills that enjoy overwhelming but not unanimous support. The House frequently resorts to this set of procedures, which includes a 40-minute debate limit, a prohibition against floor amendments, and a two-thirds vote for passage.\n\nThe House also considers legislation under the hour rule, which generally governs debate in the House itself, but in practice, most major bills are not considered under the hour rule. Instead, they are considered in the Committee of the Whole, where debate and amendment occur.\n\nThe House retains ultimate control over its legislative process, and the Rules Committee plays a crucial role in helping the majority party leadership formulate its order of business and set procedural ground rules for considering each bill.

The FLSA, enacted in 1938, authorizes the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit these exemptions. To qualify for the EAP exemption, an employee must meet three criteria: the salary basis test, the duties test, and the salary level test. The salary basis test requires a predetermined and fixed salary, while the duties test specifies the job functions for executive, administrative, and professional employees. The salary level test sets a minimum weekly salary threshold.\n\nThe FLSA applies to employees in all sectors, including nonprofits and institutions of higher education (IHEs). However, some public sector employees, such as state and local government employees, may have different compensation options, like compensatory time instead of cash payment.\n\nIn 2019, the Department of Labor (DOL) proposed updating the EAP exemptions, including an increase in the salary level test from $455 per week to $679 per week and an increase in the annual salary threshold for the highly compensated employee (HCE) exemption from $100,000 to $147,414. The proposed rule also allows up to 10% of the standard salary level to be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions.\n\nSince the FLSA's enactment, the salary level threshold has been increased eight times, with the most recent increase in 2004.

U.S. domestic crude oil production has been increasing, while consumption has remained relatively stable. The U.S. is projected to become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products by the late 2020s, which would eliminate the country's 90-day reserve obligation under the International Energy Agency (IEA). The SPR, which currently holds approximately 695 million barrels of oil, is expected to have excess capacity due to congressionally mandated sales, which could grow to over 300 million barrels by the end of fiscal year 2027.\n\nThe report highlights the need for the Department of Energy (DOE) to periodically reassess the SPR's size and configuration to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness in meeting U.S. energy security needs and IEA obligations. The report recommends that DOE conduct a strategic review of the SPR every five years, consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets, and complete studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves for all U.S. regions identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions.\n\nThe report also notes that the SPR has primarily been used in response to domestic supply disruptions, but its effectiveness in this role is limited because it is almost entirely composed of crude oil, not petroleum products. The Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015 recommended that DOE analyze the need for additional regional product reserves to address this limitation.\n\nThe report concludes by making a matter for congressional consideration: Congress may wish to consider setting a long-term target for the size and configuration of the SPR that takes into account projections for future oil production, oil consumption, and U.S. IEA obligations. The report also makes four recommendations to DOE: supplement its 2016 strategic review with an additional analysis, take actions to ensure periodic reviews of the SPR, conduct or complete studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves, and consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implemented the MSPV-NG program in 2016 to standardize medical supply requirements, improve buying power, and achieve greater efficiency in ordering and supply chain management.

The program includes hundreds of new contracts with individual supply vendors and a new set of prime vendor contracts.\n\nHowever, the implementation of MSPV-NG faced challenges. VHA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition. The initial requirements development process relied solely on data from previous clinician purchases and did not involve clinicians in the standardization process. As a result, the initial formulary did not meet the needs of medical centers and had low utilization rates.\n\nLeading hospital networks reported significant cost savings by standardizing their medical supply chains through early and frequent collaboration with clinicians. VHA could have benefited from similar practices but failed to do so due to the lack of a clear overall strategy, leadership instability, and workforce challenges.\n\nTo address these challenges, VHA agreed with GAO's recommendations to develop and document an overarching strategy for the program, prioritize hiring a permanent MSPV-NG program director, and involve clinicians in requirements development. The agency also plans to replace the current MSPV-NG contract and formulary process with a new approach where the prime vendor would develop the formulary.

Today, the code is silent on the issue, but the Secretary arguably retains implicit authority due to the location of Section 8662 in subtitle C of Title 10, which covers the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nThe Naval History and Heritage Command compiles primary and alternate ship name recommendations each year and forwards them to the Chief of Naval Operations. These recommendations are based on various factors, including the name categories for ship types, the distribution of geographic names, names of ships that distinguished themselves in service, and names recommended by individuals and groups.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Operations signs a memorandum recommending names for the current year's building program and sends it to the Secretary of the Navy, who makes the final decision. The Secretary considers these nominations, along with others, and selects names for specific ships and announces them. While there is no set time for assigning a name, it is customarily done before the ship is christened.\n\nThe July 2012 Navy report to Congress states that ship naming policies and practices are not fixed and have evolved over time. Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have changed, such as attack submarines being named for fish, cities, and states, and cruisers being named for cities, states, and battles.\n\nThe report also acknowledges exceptions to these rules, including ships named for individuals, such as Presidents and Members of Congress, and ships named for places, such as cities and territories. The Navy has a long history of naming ships for living individuals, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Robert E. Lee, but this practice fell out of favor after the War of 1812. However, it was revived in the early 1970s when Secretary of the Navy John Warner named CVN-70 for Carl Vinson, despite his being alive at the time.\n\nThe report also discusses the controversy surrounding the naming of ships for Confederate officers and American Indians, as well as the practice of announcing names for ships years before they are procured.

{"samples": ["\nThe U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment concluded that global climate change is already impacting the United States and will intensify in the future, with the severity of future impacts depending on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to changes. While international and sub-national efforts to reduce emissions are underway, federal policymakers and stakeholders hold varying views on climate change and its implications. Some argue that climate change poses an existential threat and that significant reductions in GHG emissions are necessary to avoid dire effects. They point to reports like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C and the U.S. Global Change Research Program's Fourth National Climate Assessment as evidence. Others question the need for federal action, citing potential economic impacts on domestic industries and minimal results from a unilateral approach.\n\nA carbon tax or GHG emissions fee is one policy option for addressing climate change by pricing carbon emissions. The key human-related GHG is CO2, primarily generated through fossil fuel combustion. A carbon tax could apply directly to GHG emissions or to emissions inputs, such as fossil fuels. A carbon price on emissions or their inputs would increase the relative price of more carbon-intensive energy sources, potentially spurring innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies and stimulating energy efficiency improvements. However, energy price increases could also have economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and demographic groups.\n\nThe design of a carbon tax system would involve key decisions, such as the point of taxation, rate of taxation, and potential border carbon adjustments. Policymakers could also consider distributing carbon tax revenues to mitigate economic impacts. The economic literature suggests that certain revenue recycling options, such as tax swaps or offsetting reductions in existing distortionary taxes, may reduce the economy-wide impacts of a carbon tax. However, the distributional impacts on households would depend on how the revenues are used.\n\nThe transportation sector, which contributes the largest percentage of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, may be less responsive to a carbon tax in the short term due to fewer opportunities to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels and historically insensitive driving demand. Policymakers may need to complement a carbon tax with other programs to"]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the financial situation of the Retiree Health Benefits (RHB) Fund for postal retirees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The RHB Fund, which is used to pay USPS's share of postal retiree premiums for health benefits, is projected to be depleted in 12 years under the status quo. USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund's balance is declining. The report also mentions that USPS's financial condition is deteriorating and that the outlook is bleak.\n\nThe RHB Fund is currently used by OPM to pay USPS's share of postal retiree premiums for health benefits. However, as the fund is projected to be depleted, USPS will be required to resume \"pay-as-you-go\" payments for its share of retiree health premiums. The report identifies several potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits, including increasing postal retirees' participation in Medicare, supplemental federal appropriations, tightening eligibility or reducing or eliminating retiree health benefits, increasing premium payments by postal retirees and/or postal employees, changing the federal contribution to a fixed subsidy, and establishing a non-federal voluntary employees\u2019 beneficiary association (VEBA) for postal retiree health benefits.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the need for congressional action to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. The report was reviewed and provided technical comments by OPM and USPS. USPS concurred with the need for congressional action but provided additional context and balance on some of the potential policy approaches."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), a condition that affects infants born to mothers who have used opioids during pregnancy. The report highlights that prenatal opioid use can take various forms, including prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, prescription drug misuse, and illicit drug use. The report notes that almost 22 percent of pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries filled a prescription for an opioid during their pregnancy. Medication-assisted treatment is considered the standard of care for treating pregnant women with opioid use disorders, but there is a need for more research on the most effective treatment approaches.\n\nThe report also discusses the gaps in efforts to address NAS and the challenges in treating it. There is currently no national standard of care for screening or treating NAS, and health care providers predominantly diagnose it using the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool. The report recommends that infants with NAS should not be initially treated with medication but instead, non-pharmacologic treatment should be used, such as placing the infant in a dark and quiet environment, swaddling, breastfeeding, and rooming-in with the mother. Pharmacologic treatment may be necessary for moderate to severe signs of NAS.\n\nThe report notes that more than 80 percent of NAS cases are paid for by Medicaid, and states administer their Medicaid programs according to federal requirements and state plans. The report also discusses the importance of coordinated care for mothers and infants with NAS and the need for more research on the long-term effects of prenatal drug exposure. The report concludes by recommending that the Secretary of HHS expeditiously develop a plan to effectively implement the NAS-related recommendations identified in the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy."]}

The report highlights the lack of comprehensive federal privacy law in the U.S. and the various tailored laws that govern specific aspects of privacy, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The report also mentions the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) role in addressing consumer concerns about Internet privacy using its broad authority under section 5 of the FTC Act.\n\nThe report outlines various Internet privacy concerns that have been reported by the FTC in recent years, including the collection and use of data such as Internet browsing histories, purchases, locations, and travel routes. The report also mentions the Fair Information Practice Principles, which have served as the basis for many privacy recommendations from federal agencies.\n\nThe report notes that the FTC is primarily a law enforcement agency that addresses consumer concerns about Internet privacy for both edge providers and content providers. The FTC has the authority to seek civil penalties for violations of certain privacy statutes and regulations, but it has not implemented regulations specific to privacy under the FTC Act. The report also mentions the challenges in providing Internet privacy oversight, including identifying responsible parties and addressing the rapid evolution of technology.\n\nThe report concludes by suggesting that recent developments suggest it is an appropriate time for Congress to consider comprehensive Internet privacy legislation. Such legislation could establish specific standards and provide authorities for agencies to oversee Internet privacy, including notice-and-comment rulemaking and first-time violation civil penalty authorities. The report emphasizes the importance of balancing consumers' need for Internet privacy with industry's ability to provide services and innovate."]}
{"samples": ["\nThe FBI's Hoover Building and other headquarters facilities were assessed between 2001 and 2011 by the FBI and General Services Administration (GSA), revealing gaps between current and needed capabilities in terms of security, space, and building condition. The Hoover Building, which houses approximately 2.4 million gross square feet of space, was found to have much of it unusable and inefficiently designed, making it difficult to meet the FBI's current and projected operational requirements. Security concerns include the dispersion of staff in annexes, some located in multitenant buildings, and the FBI's leasing of space from foreign owners, which could present security risks. Building condition issues include deteriorating conditions and significant recapitalization needs. Since the 2011 assessment, the FBI and GSA have attempted to address these challenges, including the cancellation of the proposed FBI headquarters consolidation project in 2017 due to a lack of funding. The GSA has also explored the use of swap exchanges to facilitate construction projects and modernize or replace federal properties, but has limited experience in successfully completing such transactions. The report recommends that GSA develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange and improve the property appraisal process to increase the viability of the swap exchange approach. The report also identifies alternative funding mechanisms for real property projects, including upfront funding, retained fees, land swaps, and public-private partnerships. Projects with alternative funding mechanisms present risks that should be managed through clear lease terms, appropriate partner selection, and risk assessment and management practices. Additionally, changes to the budgetary structure itself may help agencies meet their real property needs by altering existing or introducing new account structures."]}

The UI program includes the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program, which provides up to 26 weeks of benefits, and the Extended Benefit (EB) program, which can extend benefits up to 20 weeks during economic downturns. Eligibility for UC benefits is based on earning a certain amount of wages or working for a certain period within a 12-month base period. The UC program is financed through federal and state payroll taxes.\n\nDuring a government shutdown, furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UC benefits under the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. However, retroactive payments made to these employees during the shutdown may be considered overpayments, subject to state laws regarding recovery.\n\nIn response to the 2011 Budget Control Act, EB expenditures were subject to a 6.2% reduction in FY2019. As of January 2019, no state had activated EB during this period.\n\nThe Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) program, funded through the UTF, helps states address individual reemployment needs and prevent UI overpayments.

BOP, under JMD oversight, manages the human resource operations of its institutions, including retention incentives through its Central Office, regional offices, and institutions. The Central Office houses BOP's Human Resource Management Division (HRMD) and Program Review Division (PRD), responsible for developing, implementing, and administering human resource policies and programs, and assessing BOP programs, respectively.\n\nBOP's six regional offices oversee the operations of 122 federal institutions, with each office led by a regional director who provides local level oversight of institutions' human capital programs. Institutions are managed by a warden and other officials, with correctional services staff representing the largest segment and responsible for inmate treatment, custody, and supervision. Non-correctional services staff include those in non-correctional services management, facility operations, and health services.\n\nRetention incentives were first authorized under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 and have since been expanded under the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004. BOP funds the majority of its retention incentives through its Salaries and Expenses appropriation account and allocates funding to regional offices, which then determine how to allocate their budgets. HRMD delegates retention incentive determinations to each institution.\n\nBOP uses various compensation-based human capital flexibilities, including recruitment and relocation incentives, student loan repayments, and special salary rates, to retain and recruit staff. Retention incentive expenditures increased from $10.7 million in fiscal year 2012 to $14.0 million in fiscal year 2016, with the largest percentage of expenditures going to medical professionals and the four California institutions.\n\nBOP primarily uses retention incentives at the four California institutions to supplement correctional officers' salaries and compensate for the gap between BOP and other institutions' salaries.

{"samples": ["\nThe report discusses the increase in safety defect vehicle recalls since 2011, with notable examples being General Motors' recall of 8 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches and Takata airbag inflators recalls affecting approximately 34 million vehicles and 19 auto manufacturers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reviews draft recall notification letters to ensure they include required information about the safety defect and the manufacturer's plan to remedy it. NHTSA's Strategic Plan 2016\u20132020 aims to achieve a 100-percent completion rate for every recall by improving communication and encouraging consumers to complete repairs. Annual completion rates for passenger vehicle recalls have remained relatively flat, ranging from 63 to 67 percent between 2011 and 2014. Consumers can search for recall information on NHTSA's website using their vehicle identification number (VIN) or the year, make, and model. NHTSA launched a national advertising campaign in 2016 to encourage consumers to check for open recalls and spent about $1 million on it through March 2017. The campaign resulted in 1.1 million recall searches and a cost of about $0.90 per search. NHTSA also began a pilot grant program in 2016 to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of informing consumers about open recalls during state vehicle registration.

{"samples": ["\nCluster munitions are weapons that disperse smaller submunitions over a large area, allowing for the destruction of multiple targets with fewer weapons systems. They have been used extensively in conflicts since World War II, with significant civilian casualties and unexploded ordnance remaining decades after use. Criticisms of cluster munitions include their imprecise dispersion, high failure rates, and lack of self-destruct capabilities, leading to civilian casualties and hazardous areas.\n\nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was established in 1980 to restrict or ban specific types of weapons in armed conflicts. In 2006, negotiations began to address the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions, but an agreement was not reached. In 2008, a group of states outside of the CCW negotiated and signed an agreement to ban cluster munitions, which entered into force in 2010. The United States, Russia, China, Israel, Egypt, India, and Pakistan did not participate in the talks or sign the agreement.\n\nCluster munitions are valued by militaries for their economy of force and ability to engage large targets or areas. The United States relies heavily on cluster munitions, with every combat aircraft and maneuver element utilizing them. Eliminating cluster munitions would require significant investment in new weapons systems and logistical resources, potentially increasing the use of massed artillery and rocket barrages.\n\nThe United States has determined that its national security interests cannot be fully ensured consistent with the terms of the CCM and continues to implement its 2008 policy on cluster munitions, which recognizes the need to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure while maintaining the military utility of cluster munitions. The Pentagon's policy requires that cluster munitions used after 2018 leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield. In 2017, the policy was revised to allow combatant commanders to use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands.

FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery manages the PA grant program, which includes a mix of temporary, reservist, and permanent employees under the Stafford Act and Title 5 authorities. After a disaster, FEMA sends PA program staff to the affected area to assess damage and establish a temporary Joint Field Office (JFO) to manage response and recovery functions. PA staff work with grant applicants to document damages, identify eligible costs and work, and prepare requests for PA grant funds. The process includes developing project proposals, which may include hazard mitigation measures if they are related to the repair of damaged facilities.\n\nThe PA program can be used to fund hazard mitigation measures to reduce future risk to infrastructure. There is no preset limit to the amount of PA funds a community may receive, but hazard mitigation measures must be cost effective. Examples of cost-effective hazard mitigation measures include installing shut-off valves on underground pipelines, securing roofs, and installing shutters on windows. Applicants can propose mitigation measures separate from damaged portions of a facility, such as constructing floodwalls around damaged facilities.\n\nFEMA's Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) deploys a cadre of mitigation staff to help coordinate and implement hazard mitigation activities during disaster recovery. The PA program has faced challenges in the past related to workforce management, information sharing, and hazard mitigation. For example, there have been reports of a shortage of experienced and knowledgeable staff, reliance on temporary rotating staff, and limited training for the workforce, which impaired PA program delivery and delayed recovery efforts after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nTo address these challenges, FEMA instituted the PA Consistency Initiative in 2013, which included hiring new managers for FEMA regional offices, stakeholder training on PA program administration, and using a newly developed internal website to allow staff to post and share information to address continuity and knowledge sharing concerns during disaster operations.

In fiscal year 2017, the agency reported spending $424 million on IT, with $31 million allocated for information security. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires CDC, like all federal agencies, to establish and enforce information security policies and procedures.\n\nCDC's information security program includes the chief information officer (CIO) and chief information security officer (CISO), who oversee the protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. The agency uses a risk-based approach to information security, categorizing systems based on potential impact and implementing controls accordingly. However, a 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found deficiencies in CDC's technical controls and agency-wide information security program. These deficiencies included inadequate logging and monitoring capabilities, insufficient assessment of security controls, and failure to address vulnerabilities in a timely manner.\n\nThe GAO report identified deficiencies in all five core security function areas for the selected systems reviewed: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. For example, CDC had not always categorized systems appropriately, and high-impact systems were relying on less secure environments. The agency also had not consistently documented risks associated with less secure configuration settings or monitored assessments to address changes to the operating environment.\n\nTo address these deficiencies, CDC has taken steps to improve its technical security controls and information security program.

{"samples": ["\nIn March 2015, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to intervene in Yemen against the Ansar Allah/Houthi movement and loyalists of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The United States provided logistical and intelligence support to the coalition without taking direct military action. The Obama Administration supported UN Security Council Resolution 2216, which imposed an arms embargo on the Houthis and demanded their withdrawal from seized areas. Since then, Congress has debated various legislative proposals related to Yemen, including reducing civilian casualties, improving humanitarian conditions, combating Iranian support for the Houthis, preserving maritime security, and supporting coalition efforts against Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces. Debate in Congress has been influenced by regional tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as concerns over the U.S.-Saudi relationship following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Obama Administration attempted to balance humanitarian concerns with support for Gulf partners, leading to some delays and additional notification requests for arms sales. In the fall of 2015, opposition to U.S. support for the coalition began to coalesce amid growing international criticism of civilian casualties and human rights abuses. In 2016, legislation was introduced to place conditions on future arms sales to Saudi Arabia, but it was not enacted. The Obama Administration reduced some support for the coalition's air campaign and initiated a review of U.S. security assistance. In August 2016, the coalition resumed bombing after peace talks collapsed, and U.S. Armed Forces came under direct fire for the first time.

{"samples": ["The professor suggested that echoes and pre-echoes, which can be part of the problem in speech recognition, could be removed by setting very low or near zero values for very low-energy sections in the speech signal. He also mentioned that reverberation could be reduced by doing some sort of VAD-like thing and then using a high-pass filter. However, he noted that this could potentially throw away speech as well as echoes, so it should be done conservatively. The professor also mentioned that the processing for re-synthesis doesn't have to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original according to some equation, and that it could be done to make it nicer. He also wondered if the reverberation time in the room was around 0.7 to 0.8 seconds."]}

{"samples": ["The context does not provide a clear summary of evaluations on the legitimacy of children's rights, protection, and demands. However, it is mentioned that the Welsh Government is launching a survey of children to gather their views on the COVID-19 situation and its impact on their lives. Additionally, it is stated that no children's rights impact assessments have been done due to the need to make legislation quickly during the crisis. The Welsh Government has taken a strong line against introducing easements in requirements to children's social services, and assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns. Some childcare settings are falling between the cracks and not receiving financial support, and the Welsh Government is looking for ways to help them. The childcare sector is fragile and heavily reliant on fees paid by parents, and the number of children attending has been reduced due to social distancing and lockdown measures. The coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which provides free access to childcare for critical workers and vulnerable children, has only been up and running for a few weeks and the numbers of children accessing it are still low. The family courts are holding hearings virtually, but complex cases are being postponed to be heard at a later date. The president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, and the Welsh Government has provided guidance on staying at home and away from others. Where parents have joint parental responsibility, children under 18 can be moved between the two households, but it is on a case-by-case basis for other children. CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all and are sending in their views virtually, and there do not seem to be any major issues arising."]}

{"samples": ["The meeting discussed that universities have invested in their estates through borrowings, and the costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis. The operating cash that universities are generating has been decreasing, and the costs of servicing those borrowings are becoming a significant proportion of the operating cash that universities have. The challenge is that income, particularly fee income, is not increasing, and this is putting pressure on universities to manage their finances carefully. The universities with significant reserves tied up in their estates are not necessarily in a better position, as those reserves are not immediately realisable. The sector is facing financial challenges due to a demographic dip of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and increased costs generally, as well as uncertainty from the Augar review in England and Brexit. However, the performance of the sector is still very good, with Wales having the best impact from research in Wales across the UK and the best national student survey results in the UK. The Diamond reforms, which will bring additional funding to the sector, are expected to be important in addressing these challenges."]}

The expected police eviction had not occurred by late Sunday evening, and city officials continued to avoid commenting on when or if they would remove the protesters. In Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall early Monday and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to disperse or face arrest. No arrests had been made as of that time, and police had no plans to clear the encampment at City Hall Park.\n\nBoth encampments have been in place for several weeks, with the Los Angeles encampment being one of the largest on the West Coast. The Los Angeles encampment had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, with at least a third of campers being homeless. In Philadelphia, many tents and other structures remained at the encampment after the deadline passed, and police were hoping that the rest of the protesters would relocate voluntarily.\n\nThe Occupy movement, which began in New York City in September, is a national protest against economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. In both cities, supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights, and other groups streamed in to show their support for the protesters.\n\nMayor Nutter had cited health and safety concerns as the reason for the eviction deadline in Philadelphia, but some protesters believed the city could have done more to help them find a new location. In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa had given protesters until midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal. However, police ultimately permitted the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak.\n\nBoth mayors expressed hope that the protests would remain peaceful and avoid the sporadic violence that had erupted in other cities when police used force against Occupy protesters.

In the letter, Kalashnikov, who died at the age of 94, questioned whether he was responsible for the many lives lost due to his invention. He described his spiritual pain and wondered if he, as a Christian and an Orthodox believer, could be held accountable for the deaths of those who were killed by his weapon.\n\nThe letter, published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, was typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and signed with a wavering hand. It is unclear how much of the letter Kalashnikov wrote himself, as his daughter, Elena, believes a priest may have helped him compose it.\n\nKalashnikov came up with the design for the AK-47 after experiencing the Red Army's lack of weapons during World War II. The rifle, known for its durability and simplicity, has since been widely manufactured unlicensed around the world and has become a visual hallmark of armed insurgent movements, including those using child soldiers.\n\nDespite the weapon's widespread use, Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many lives lost, instead blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. However, he expressed sadness at seeing his rifle used by criminals and terrorists.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church received Kalashnikov's letter and wrote a personal reply, with the press secretary, Alexander Volkov, stating that the Church supports the creators and soldiers who use weapons to protect their country.\n\nKalashnikov received many Russian state honors but made little money from his gun.

Ciancia, who had a note expressing his desire to \"kill TSA\" and criticizing their searches as unconstitutional, was shot and wounded by airport police. He is currently in fair condition and facing charges that carry a potential death sentence for the murder of Hernandez and the wounding of three other TSA officers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, it was revealed that Hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes before being transported to the hospital. During this time, there was no threat from the suspected gunman, who had been shot and was in custody. Paramedics were unable to enter the terminal due to police not declaring it safe. The lack of coordination between police and fire officials is being investigated as a possible contributing factor to Hernandez's death.\n\nOn the same day as the memorial service for Hernandez, it was announced that Ciancia's condition had been upgraded from critical to fair at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Hundreds of people attended the memorial service to honor Hernandez, who was the first TSA officer to be killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the lack of coordination between different law enforcement agencies at LAX and the response time in active shooter situations. Police are now trained to immediately charge in to stop the shooting and tend to victims afterwards. However, a recent audit found that the LAPD had a zero percent compliance rate for first aid and CPR training for its sworn officers. Airport police, on the other hand, have the required training.\n\nThe shooting also led to increased security measures at LAX, including the deployment of additional officers and the implementation of new screening procedures.

Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty.\n\nMcCullough, who had long maintained his innocence, was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. His stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, was present in the courtroom and was seen signaling \"I love you\" to him after the ruling.\n\nThe case gained national attention in the 1950s when reports of child abductions were rare. Maria Ridulph had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on December 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny,\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she returned, Maria and the man were gone.\n\nProsecutors at McCullough's trial in 2012 said he was Johnny, as he went by that name in his youth.

{"samples": ["Two studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have revealed that cigarette smoke and electronic cigarette vapor can make the superbug Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) more resistant to treatment. MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections and is often resistant to antibiotics.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, immune cells that devour infectious agents. The smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, two lines of immune defense used to kill bacteria. The study also discovered that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, making it more successful in invasions.\n\nThe second study, also published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances the bacteria's survival against reactive oxygen species and makes it four times more resistant to macrophage killing. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.\n\nBoth studies suggest that cigarette smoke and electronic cigarette vapor make MRSA more resistant to common forms of immune responses, making it even more difficult to treat. The studies were performed to examine an alternative theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker, but instead, the smoke makes the pathogen tougher. The researchers hope that their findings will add yet another reason for individuals to refrain from smoking.\n\nThe studies were led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, and were funded in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."]}

Samsung's new privacy policy for its smart TVs allows the company and its partners to listen in on users' conversations, drawing comparisons to George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. The policy states that Samsung may collect associated texts and other usage data to improve the performance of the feature. Users can disable the feature but will lose the voice recognition functionality. The similarities to the telescreens used in 1984 have raised concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of data.\n\nMicrosoft's new Xbox One console, on the other hand, will always be listening for the command \"Xbox On\" to power up, even when turned off. The new Kinect peripheral, which comes with every Xbox One, is used for voice commands and motion sensing. Microsoft claims the new Kinect is so sensitive that it can read heartbeats and recognize individual voices. While the system is not necessarily recording, the always-listening feature has raised privacy concerns, especially if the system is compromised remotely.\n\nBoth companies have faced privacy concerns in the past regarding their use of personal data. Microsoft's first Kinect, which was only enabled in specific situations and did not have an always-listening mode, faced privacy concerns when Microsoft suggested it might pass data to advertisers. Samsung's smart TVs have also faced privacy concerns, with some users expressing unease about the amount of data being collected and transmitted.\n\nMicrosoft has stated that the new Kinect is listening for a specific cue and has strong privacy protections in place.

The lawsuit claimed that the cheerleaders were paid only $150 per game and nothing for practice time, resulting in hourly wages significantly below the minimum wage. Each of the 52 cheerleaders will receive $2,500 for each season they worked during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 NFL seasons. Cheerleaders who participated in photo shoots are eligible for an additional $400 payment per shoot.\n\nThe Jets initially reached a settlement agreement in August 2015 but had to return to court due to objections from some cheerleaders. The final settlement amount will include interest and depend on how many football seasons each cheerleader worked. The Jets denied the claims and agreed to the settlement to avoid the expense, time, and distraction of litigation.\n\nKrystal's lawsuit argued that the actual hourly pay for the cheerleaders was below minimum wage when factoring in required hair, makeup, and transportation expenses. The Jets, like other NFL teams, have tried to justify the low pay by labeling cheerleaders as independent contractors rather than employees. However, courts have not agreed with this distinction.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills cheerleaders, called the Buffalo Jills, were recently granted class-action status in a similar wage lawsuit against their team. The Jills claimed they had to live by a strict code of conduct that dictated their appearance, eating habits, and even how they used feminine products.

This is more than double the number of cases reported in 2015. AFM affects the spinal cord and can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses. The best prevention is to wash hands, stay updated on vaccinations, and protect against mosquitoes.\n\nThe condition was first diagnosed in a 3-year-old boy named Carter Roberts from Chesterfield, Virginia, who went from a healthy, active child to a paralyzed patient unable to move his arms or legs within a weekend. His diagnosis came after an MRI scan and hours of waiting for doctors to figure out what was wrong.\n\nThe CDC reported that AFM can cause limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or slurred speech. Symptoms include sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, and the best course of action is to contact a healthcare provider for assessment. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department.\n\nThe illness peaked in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December, mostly affecting children. The average age for children stricken with AFM is 7, and most had to be placed on respirators. Although 85% of the children recovered partially, only three have fully recovered.\n\nThe cause of AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment. The best prevention is to maintain good hygiene and protect against mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM.\n\nLaura Carson, a mother whose 4-year-old daughter Laura was diagnosed with AFM in 2014, shared her family's experience.

Two new forensic investigations have suggested that the shroud may be a fake due to inconsistent bloodstain patterns.\n\nThe first study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, was conducted by forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences. They used a live subject and a mannequin to analyze the blood flow on wounds on the left hand, forearms, the \"lance wound\" in the torso, and blood stains around the figure's waist. The researchers used two types of blood: human blood donated for the research and synthetic blood with the same fluid properties.\n\nThe researchers found that the blood flow tests on the shroud were inconsistent. For instance, the trickles on the back of the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two completely different angles. The spear wound bled in a direction consistent with the Shroud image when the test subject was upright, but it formed rivulets, rather than a solidly filled stain. The lower back stain could not be replicated at all.\n\nThe second investigation, also reported in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, reached similar conclusions. Researchers found that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse. Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University, told BuzzFeed News that even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\n\nDespite these findings, the Shroud of Turin remains a subject of fascination for many, and the debate over its authenticity is far from over. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and has never officially weighed in on its authenticity. The shroud has been held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, since the late 16th century and has been the subject of numerous analyses and studies over the centuries."]}

{"samples": ["In late February 2017, Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and the half-brother of current leader Kim Jong-un, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. Malaysian authorities have confirmed that he was killed using the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent. The substance was detected on Kim's eyes and face, and one of the two women accused of carrying out the attack later fell ill with vomiting. Malaysian police are still investigating how the lethal agent entered the country.\n\nKim Jong-nam, who had lived abroad for years and was bypassed in favor of his half-brother as a potential future leader, had been considered a critic of the North Korean regime. He had been traveling on a passport under the name Kim Chol. North Korea has yet to confirm his identity.\n\nThe use of VX nerve agent at the airport raised serious concerns about public safety, as the substance can remain lethal for a long time and can take days or even weeks to evaporate. Authorities went 11 days without decontaminating the airport, and it is unclear if any other places Kim had been, including medical facilities and the ambulance he was transported in, have been decontaminated.\n\nNorth Korea has denied any involvement in the assassination and accused Malaysia of fabricating evidence. The country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur has demanded the return of the body, which remains in the hospital's mortuary amid a diplomatic dispute.\n\nMalaysian investigators believe the two female suspects, one Indonesian and one Vietnamese, coated their hands with chemicals and wiped them on Kim's face as he waited for a flight home to Macau. Kim sought help from airport staff but died on the way to the hospital within two hours of the attack.\n\nThe use of VX nerve agent has raised concerns about North Korea's chemical weapons capabilities. The country is believed to have the third largest stockpile of chemical weapons, after the US and Russia, with an estimated inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea is one of only six countries not to have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.\n\n"]}

Two suspects, a 21-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy, have been arrested, with the man being charged with rape, kidnapping, and robbery, and the boy with sexual assault. Police believe as many as 10 assailants, ranging in age from 15 to their early 20s, were involved in the assault, which lasted for over two hours. The girl was left semiconscious and naked from the waist down near a picnic table, and remains hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nThe attack has rattled the crime-ridden city of Richmond, which had 47 homicides in 2007, making it the state's leader for cities with populations of 100,000 or more. The number of homicides dropped to 27 in 2008 but has spiked to 44 so far this year. The victim had left the dance and was drinking alcohol in a school courtyard with a group when she was attacked. Some students have already left the school in response to the assault.\n\nPolice initially believed about six young men were involved, but now believe the number to be higher. As many as two dozen people may have witnessed the assault but did not report it to authorities. The girl knew at least one of the assailants, the 15-year-old boy. The attack began when she was invited to join a drinking session after the dance.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about campus security. Richmond High has surveillance cameras, but none are currently working. A new system is expected to be in place in the next few months. Four police officers and several school security staffers were on hand at the homecoming dance, but two of the staffers left early due to a prior commitment. Police initially believed they had enough officers on hand to provide security.\n\nThe attack has been described as one of the most heinous crimes in the memory of the investigating officers.

The memo, which had been kept classified, was released to the public after the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted to do so and the President authorized its declassification. The memo raised concerns about the legitimacy and legality of certain interactions between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nThe memo specifically mentioned that the FBI and DOJ obtained a FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three renewals from the FISC. It was noted that the government had at least four opportunities to provide all material and relevant facts to the FISC but failed to do so. The memo also criticized the role of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton campaign in funding the dossier used in the FISA application, as well as the FBI's reliance on a Yahoo News article that did not corroborate the dossier.\n\nIn the second passage, there was a tweet about adding location information to tweets.

The film, directed by Joe Johnston, attempts to blend the gothic storytelling of the original with modern horror elements. However, critics have noted an uneasy fusion of traditional makeup and CGI, as well as a lackluster performance from Del Toro in the title role.\n\nMeanwhile, Garry Marshall's \"Valentine's Day\" is a romantic comedy featuring an ensemble cast, including Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, and Ashton Kutcher. Critics have panned the film for its predictable plot and lack of humor, with some going so far as to call it a \"Repression-Era Special.\"\n\nIn other news, the critically acclaimed Arab-Israeli drama \"Ajami\" has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.

The arrest came after a file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) following the interview. McConville, a widowed mother of 10, was abducted from her home in Belfast and secretly buried after being wrongly accused of being an informer to the British Army. Her body was found on a beach in County Louth in 2003.\n\nAdams criticized the timing of his arrest, which occurred during an election campaign, and claimed there was a \"sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign\" alleging his involvement in the murder. He had contacted the police two months prior to his arrest and went voluntarily to the station for questioning. The Sinn Fein leader questioned the need for his arrest under the terrorism act and the use of \"pernicious, coercive legislation to deal with a legacy issue.\"\n\nMcConville's son, Michael, expressed his family's determination to continue the fight for justice. He stated, \"We know it is going to be a long road, but we have already been fighting for justice for 40 odd years and we are not going to stop now.\"\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron discussed Adams' release with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny. Loyalist groups blocked the front of the police station during Adams' release, and there were reports of disorder in the loyalist Sandy Row area of south Belfast.\n\nOther political parties rejected claims that the timing of the arrest was political. Democratic Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson and Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt both spoke out in support of the police investigation and against any interference in the process.\n\nThe decision to release Adams means that prosecution lawyers will now decide if charges will be brought against him. The file sent by the police to the PPS will detail the evidence gathered, and it is up to the lawyers to decide if there is enough evidence to bring any charges and what those charges would be.

She was denied bail at a court appearance on Dec. 26. Gonzalez was charged with five misdemeanor counts of causing the circumstances of child endangerment.\n\nSurveillance footage allegedly showed Cosme applying hot glue directly to the hands and arms of the five 2-year-old children, causing injury.

{"samples": ["In the upcoming memoirs of Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, she reveals two personal experiences with terminated pregnancies. In the late 1990s, Davis and her then-husband made the difficult decision to end a much-wanted pregnancy after discovering their unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. The baby, whom they had named Tate Elise, was diagnosed with a syndrome that would likely cause suffering and be incompatible with life. Davis writes that she and her husband spent time with Tate after her birth, had her baptized, and said their goodbyes before her body was taken away the following day. The experience left Davis with a deep sense of grief and despair, but also changed her forever.\n\nBefore her political career, Davis also had an ectopic pregnancy in 1994. In this case, the fetus implanted outside the uterus, and terminating the pregnancy was considered medically necessary due to the risk to her health. Davis writes that in Texas, such pregnancies are technically considered abortions, and doctors have to report them as such.\n\nDavis rose to national prominence in 2013 when she filibustered against tighter abortion restrictions in the Texas Senate. Her personal experiences with terminated pregnancies were not mentioned during the filibuster, but she considered sharing her story to highlight the importance of women's access to healthcare. The filibuster set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol and drew national attention, with President Barack Obama tweeting his support.\n\nThe revelations in Davis' memoir come as she trails in the polls against her Republican opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Governor Rick Perry. Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race, with Abbott opposing the procedure even in cases of rape and incest. Rice University political scientist Mark Jones does not expect the revelations to lose any votes for Davis, as it is a small proportion of voters who oppose abortion in cases of severe fetal abnormality. Instead, the memoir humanizes Davis and makes it more difficult for opponents to attack her on the abortion issue.\n\nDavis' memoir, titled \"Forgetting to Be Afraid,\" goes on sale to the general public on Tuesday.

The investigation began earlier this year after reports of increased prostitution activity in the city, with most of the activity centered around the areas of First, Adam, North, Linden and Wahconah streets.\n\nLambach allegedly recruited women, many of whom had drug addictions, by photographing them and posting advertisements online for sexual services. He would then arrange meetings and set rates with prospective clients. Van Wert allowed some of these meetings to take place in his third-floor apartment in a senior living facility in exchange for drugs and cash.\n\nLambach also worked as a chauffeur, transporting the women to and from specific locations and waiting until they were done. He reportedly crossed state lines on at least one occasion and took a significant cut of the women's money or paid them in heroin, cocaine, or prescription drugs instead of cash. Some of the women he recruited were formerly his foster children.\n\nOne woman told police that Lambach threatened to turn her in if she stopped working for him and warned her that the police would not believe her because she was a \"drug addict and a whore.\" A witness reportedly saw photos of the prostitutes that Lambach showed her, and estimated that some of the women looked to be as young as 15.\n\nBoth men were arrested last week and held on human trafficking charges ahead of a hearing later this month.

At Marden Henge, a Neolithic house believed to be one of the best preserved from the period in the UK was unearthed. The house, which was once covered with white chalk and neatly levelled, produced various finds including flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, a Roman brooch, and even a tiny vole jawbone. Analysis of the seeds and charred grains recovered will reveal what the people were growing and eating. The house, which stood on a terrace overlooking a mound within a small earth-banked circle, was not a permanent residence but was likely used for great gatherings for feasts. The massive enclosure, which once stood three metres tall and enclosed a vast space of 15 hectares, was most likely used for status and showing off wealth and power.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child was discovered. The child, which was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace, will undergo scientific analysis to determine its gender, diet, pathologies, and date of burial. The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. Findings to date include flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch.

The awards followed a year of job cuts and spending reductions in response to falling oil prices.\n\nLeading shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis criticized the decision, recommending shareholders vote against the payment plans. The company's compensation committee awards bonuses based on strategic areas, including safety record and operational cash flow. BP executives argued that they had managed well in a difficult environment and achieved excellent safety and operational risk performance.\n\nThis was not the first time Glass Lewis had raised objections to BP's executive pay. Last year, it also recommended that shareholders reject Dudley's pay package due to its outpacing of similar-sized firms' CEO compensation and the company's relative underperformance. The executive's compensation was ultimately approved by around 86% of investors.\n\nBP's shareholders voted on the matter at the company's annual general meeting in London on April 16, along with other issues. Glass Lewis also raised concerns about the company's proposal to reduce its notice period for calling a general meeting but supported most of the proposals, including the re-election of Dudley and his board.\n\nThe rebellion against BP's executive pay was part of a growing trend of institutional investors and advisers taking a more aggressive stance on pay.

This theropod dinosaur, which lived approximately 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is significant due to its stunningly preserved remains, which include iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and parts of its tail. These feathers, which resemble those of modern hummingbirds, may have provided a social or sexual cue for the dinosaur. Caihong had a bird-like body with feathers that could have facilitated flight, but also possessed a crested head resembling that of a Velociraptor.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong's feathers, which were preserved along with its bones due to exceptional conditions, suggests that feathers originally evolved for display purposes and later developed the traits necessary for flight. The dinosaur is estimated to have been duck-sized and weighed roughly a pound.\n\nThe team of scientists, led by Dongyu Hu of China's Shenyang Normal University, examined the fossil and found traces of pigment in its feathers. They sampled 66 sites across the fossil and compared the melanosomes they observed with those from modern bird feathers. The melanosomes on Caihong's head, chest, and tail were long, flat, and organized into sheets, most closely resembling those in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds.\n\nAlthough the researchers couldn't determine the exact colors of Caihong's feathers, they suspect that the observed pigments gave the dinosaur a rainbow glimmer. Previously, scientists had observed iridescence in the feathered dinosaur Microraptor, but it lived 40 million years after Caihong and was iridescent all over.\n\nCaihong's discovery adds to our understanding of the diversity and complexity of dinosaur plumage. The dinosaur may have used its iridescent feathers for display, but it also had a funky crest of bone sticking up in front of its eyes, which could have been another display structure.

After hitting rock bottom, she found solace in cooking and went on to write a cooking column and open a bookstore in London. It was there that she was discovered by a television producer and teamed up with Paterson for \"Two Fat Ladies,\" which ran from 1996 to 1999.\n\nThe show's unique charm came from the duo's irreverent humor and their refusal to conform to the health-conscious trends of the time. They spoke approvingly of royal mistresses and less so of vegetarians, and were known for their indulgent and sometimes confounding recipes. Each episode opened with the pair traveling to a new location to cook, with Paterson driving and Dickson Wright riding in a sidecar.\n\nFollowing Paterson's death from lung cancer in 1999, Dickson Wright went on to front several television shows solo, including \"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner\" in 2012. She was also an outspoken campaigner for rural life and a keen supporter of the Countryside Alliance. In 2009, she was convicted of attending a hare coursing event.\n\nDickson Wright was also known for her strong opinions and her fiery temper, which earned her the nickname \"Krakatoa.\" She was a champion of countryside pursuits and was prepared to go to prison to support people's right to hunt. In more recent years, she joined the debate over the badger cull and suggested that the mammals ought to be eaten to solve the problem.\n\nDespite her television persona, Dickson Wright was not all puns and off-color jokes. In 2011, she published a well-received book, \"A History of English Food.\""]}

The couple, from Stockport, decided against going to the summit as dusk approached and used only Mr. Wilson's phone to find a route down the mountain's west face. Mrs. Wilson went ahead to look for a suitable route and asked her husband if it was safe. However, he heard exclamations and the sound of a rock fall, realizing his wife had fallen. Unable to help her with limited first-aid knowledge, Mr. Wilson climbed to a safer ledge and raised the alarm.\n\nThe Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team led Mr. Wilson to safety and found his wife's body over 150 meters lower down. She had fractured her skull and sustained several other severe injuries. Detective Constable Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, told the inquest that Mrs. Wilson had fallen about 30 feet down a vertical cliff and then tumbled about 150 meters down into an area known as Notch arrete. Although the weather was dry, her light boots were not suitable for such rough terrain, and she could have slipped.\n\nChris Lloyd, a member of the Ogwen Rescue team, described the route the pair had taken as \"not a straightforward path\" and warned that Tryfan is responsible for about 30% of the incidents the Ogwen Rescue team had to attend. He advised anyone climbing the North Ridge for the first time to go with someone who has experienced the North Ridge before.\n\nAndy Simpson, a spokesman for Mountain Rescue England and Wales, also urged walkers to use a map and compass in addition to electronic navigation aids, as electronic maps may have poor detail and mobile phone batteries can run out at the most inconvenient times.\n\nDetective Constable Tim Bird confirmed that Mr. Wilson had been using an Ordnance Survey app on his smartphone, but the image would have been small and not as detailed as on a proper map.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, has led to significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade at Costco increasing from $15.99 to $26.33. The tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages.\n\nRetailers like Costco have responded by directing customers to locations outside city limits where they can buy the product without paying the added tax. The tax has been criticized for being regressive and disproportionately affecting low-income families. Some argue that it does not make people healthier, but instead drives revenue outside city limits and makes the poor poorer.\n\nThe tax has also been compared to a similar tax in Cook County, Illinois, which was repealed within two months due to public outcry and negative economic impact on retailers. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association sued the county to get the tax thrown out before it took effect, and several retailers have been sued for allegedly misapplying the tax.\n\nDespite the controversy, some Seattle leaders argue that the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to health issues such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. The tax is expected to generate $15 million in revenue for the city this year, which will be used to help fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families.\n\nHowever, the tax has also faced opposition from businesses and consumers, with some arguing that it will hurt local businesses and disproportionately affect low-income families. A bill is currently being re-introduced in the Washington state legislature to bring the tax statewide, but it is unlikely to pass this year.\n\nOverall, the Seattle soda tax has sparked heated debate and controversy, with some arguing that it is an effective way to improve public health and reduce health care costs, while others argue that it is a regressive tax that disproportionately affects low-income families and drives revenue outside city limits."]}

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in the Danish National Birth Cohort, found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or being prescribed ADHD medications. However, it's important to note that the study did not find that acetaminophen causes ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors, led by Dr. Beate Ritz of the University of California, Los Angeles, concluded that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks. When women reported use for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication.\n\nThe study has sparked debate among experts. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, questioned the relevance of the cited literature and warned against jumping to conclusions.

{"samples": ["\nThe much-anticipated film adaptation of Alice Sebold's bestselling novel \"The Lovely Bones\" has received mixed reviews from critics. The story, which follows a 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon who is murdered and watches her family and killer from an in-between state, was brought to life by director Peter Jackson and his collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The film, which stars Saoirse Ronan as Susie, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as her parents, and Stanley Tucci as the murderer George Harvey, opened on December 11.\n\nCritics have praised Ronan's performance as Susie, which is described as natural, honest, and radiant. However, some have criticized the film for its uneven tone and excessive focus on the darker, more disturbing elements of the story. Jackson's decision to give a more prominent role to the murderer and his underground lair has been particularly noted as a misstep, as it detracts from the overall balance of the story.\n\nThe film's visual effects, which include a dreamlike in-between world for Susie, have also been a point of contention. Some critics have praised the imaginative and beautiful look of the world, while others have found it to be cheesy and artificial. The film's rating of PG-13 for mature themes and disturbing violent content has also been a topic of discussion, with some feeling that the film does not go far enough in depicting the harsh realities of Susie's murder and the aftermath.\n\nDespite these criticisms, many have noted the strong performances of the cast, particularly Wahlberg and Weisz as grieving parents, and the film's ability to evoke emotion and resonate with audiences. Overall, \"The Lovely Bones\" is a complex and thought-provoking film that, while not perfect, offers a unique and haunting take on the story of a murdered girl and her family's journey towards healing."]}

The incident occurred during a military operation against fuel pipeline thieves in the town of Palmarito, Puebla State, on May 3, 2017. The video, which was first published by Diario Cambio, quickly gained widespread attention and condemnation, leading the defense department to pledge an investigation into its authenticity and the Attorney General's Office to launch a probe into the events. However, no signs of an investigation were visible at the scene, with bullet-pocked facades and reluctant residents the only indications of the disturbing incident.\n\nThe military initially claimed that the thieves had used local residents as human shields in an ambush on an army patrol, resulting in the deaths of ten people. Reinforcements of 1,000 soldiers and police were sent in, and hours later another patrol was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of two more soldiers and three attackers. It is unclear if the execution depicted in the video is connected to either of these incidents.\n\nThe heavily edited security camera footage shows a silver car reversing into the frame, with gunshots hitting it and marks already visible on its windshield. The driver is briefly illuminated as he steps out of the car, and is then surrounded by soldiers. Minutes later, a man is seen lying face down in the street, and a soldier steps toward him and appears to shoot him in the back of the head. The man's body remains in the street for several minutes, with soldiers walking around him.\n\nThe defense ministry has urged federal prosecutors to investigate the video, which threatens to spark a new scandal for the armed forces. The army has been embroiled in a number of scandals in recent years over the use of extrajudicial force, embarrassing the government and undermining its efforts to clamp down on widespread gang violence. In 2014 and 2015, two shootouts between federal security forces and suspected gang members resulted in over 60 deaths, prompting accusations of extrajudicial killings.

{"samples": ["A group of truck drivers, identified as \"Truckers for the Constitution,\" are planning to protest the federal government by intentionally clogging the inner loop of the Washington, D.C., beltway beginning on October 11. The protest aims to bring attention to various frustrations within the trucking industry and express disapproval of national political leaders. Earl Conlon, a coordinator of the event, stated that tractor-trailer drivers will circle the beltway \"three lanes deep\" and keep the left lane open for emergency vehicles. Drivers wishing to pass the convoy must have \"T2SDA\" (an acronym for the event's original name, \"Truckers to Shut Down America\") written on their vehicles.\n\nThe truckers' primary goal is to seek the arrest of congressmen for allegedly disregarding the Constitution. They plan to use the idea of a citizens' grand jury to indict the officials. However, it's highly unlikely that anyone attempting to arrest a member of Congress would not be arrested themselves for attempted kidnapping.\n\nThe truckers' grievances include Environmental Protection Agency fuel efficiency standards, high diesel fuel costs, and perceived deterioration of Fourth Amendment rights protecting truckers' cabs. They also criticize members of Congress for supporting the arming of Syrian rebels, which they believe is an act against the Constitution. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Dianne Feinstein are among the politicians identified for potential arrest.\n\nThe protest has gained significant attention, with over 50,000 likes on a Facebook page advertising the event. However, the impact on D.C. area traffic depends on the number and intensity level of participants. A similar protest in 2007 against illegal immigration and competition from Mexican truckers did not disrupt commutes as feared.\n\nIt's important to note that the truckers' plan to arrest members of Congress is highly unlikely to succeed and could result in legal consequences for the participants. The protest serves as an expression of frustration and a call for change within the trucking industry and the political landscape."]}

Anthony Scaramucci: The White House Communications Director served for just ten days in 2017 before being fired. His tenure was marked by apparent protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview with The New Yorker.\n\n2. Chris Christie: The Governor of New Jersey had the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country and in the history of the Garden State. His reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal and his fawning over Donald Trump, who eventually decided not to include him in his cabinet.\n\n3. James Comey: The former Director of the FBI was criticized for publicly attacking Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election and for announcing her as the subject of an FBI investigation just days before the election. Trump fired Comey less than five months into his presidency, providing conflicting justifications for the move.\n\n4. Mark Fields: The CEO of Ford Motor Company was let go in 2017 due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure, and his determination to take on Tesla in electric and autonomous vehicle technology did not sit well with shareholders.\n\n5. Tiger Woods: The professional golfer, once the top-ranked golfer in the world, has been embroiled in controversy since reports of his infidelity came to light in 2009. He has not won a major tournament since and was recently involved in a DUI arrest, which revealed he was suffering from a dangerous combination of prescription medications.

The House of Representatives passed a bill to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama have vowed to reject any changes to the health law. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to continue the fight against Obamacare, but a government shutdown could have serious consequences for the economy, particularly in the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors.\n\nAccording to a local economist, a government shutdown could cost the Washington region an estimated $200 million a day and result in more than 700,000 jobs taking a financial hit. The shutdown would also mean cuts in federal services, including no new applications for benefits such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies, no new housing or small-business loans, and a murky prognosis for the safety net for those most in need. Child-care centers in federal agencies would close, and parents and child-care workers would be sent home.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has taken a hardline stance against the House Republicans and urged President Obama to scrap plans for a meeting with the four congressional leaders to avert a shutdown. Reid believes that such a meeting would be a photo-op with no substance, and Democrats are determined to keep the government funded without any anti-Obamacare provisions. Republicans, on the other hand, are trying to shift the blame for a potential shutdown onto Reid and are calling on him to summon the Senate back to vote on their budget bill.\n\nThe possible shutdown comes at a time when the region's economy is already weak, with across-the-board sequestration cuts costing the region 26,500 net jobs in August.

The mission, which is scheduled to launch in July 2018, will come closer to the sun than any spacecraft in history, performing 24 close flybys of the sun and bringing it within just 3.9 million miles of the solar surface. The probe will be equipped with a 7.5-foot-wide heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material and will carry a chip loaded with photographs of Parker and his seminal solar-wind paper.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe aims to answer two long-standing puzzles: how is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, so much hotter than the solar surface? Understanding these questions is crucial as solar storms can cause significant damage to satellites and power supplies, with estimates suggesting that a major solar event could cause $2 trillion in damage in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe mission will carry four science instruments to measure the sun's electric and magnetic fields, photograph solar structure, and study the solar wind. The observations and data could provide insight into the physics of stars, change what we know about the corona, increase understanding of solar wind, and help improve forecasting of major space weather events.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be the first mission to the sun and its outermost atmosphere, called the corona. It will have to withstand extreme heat and radiation, making it a historic and challenging mission. NASA has invited Parker to come up with an inscription for a plate that will be installed on the spacecraft.\n\nThe probe's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\n\nThe mission's launch window opens in July 2018, and it will take seven flybys of Venus to reach an orbit around the sun.

In Kenya, Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion and a popular tourist attraction, was shot and killed by wildlife rangers after attacking a man in a crowd. The incident sparked outrage on social media, with many questioning why tranquilizers were not used instead. Mohawk had reportedly been tormented by a crowd for hours before the attack and had broken through the protective fence surrounding the park. In South Africa, Sylvester, a 3-year-old male lion, also escaped from his park and was being hunted after officials deemed him a threat to humans. Wildlife experts were considering various options for relocating or capturing the lion, but the decision to kill him was met with opposition from animal rights activists.\n\nThe incidents highlight the delicate balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders. Last year, the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe by an American dentist caused international outrage and intensified concerns about the threatened species.\n\nThe circumstances of the stray lions also raised questions about the use of tranquilizers versus lethal force in managing dangerous wildlife. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources, and the population density of the area where the lion is roaming. In some cases, local residents have taken matters into their own hands and killed lions before officials arrived on the scene.\n\nIn Kenya, wildlife officials said they had no choice but to kill Mohawk due to the immediate threat he posed to human life. However, some critics argued that the situation could have been handled differently, and Isinya deputy county commissioner David Kipkemei expressed regret over the lion's death.\n\nIn South Africa, wildlife officials initially stated that they would kill Sylvester but later backtracked and were considering various options for relocating or capturing the lion.

Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they have found the best evidence yet for a true ninth planet, which they call \"Planet Nine.\" This elusive planet is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and is believed to be located in the outermost regions of the solar system, beyond the orbit of Neptune.\n\nBrown and Batygin have not yet observed Planet Nine directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. These smaller bodies have orbits that appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet, which they call a \"massive perturber.\" Telescopes on at least two continents are currently searching for the object, which would be the fifth-largest planet in our solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would have significant implications for our understanding of the solar system. Pluto, which was once considered the ninth planet, was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the term \"planet.\" Brown's observations of the outer solar system led to the reconsideration of the definition and the demotion of Pluto.

{"samples": ["A new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that for individuals with coronary artery disease, rapidly losing and regaining weight, or \"yo-yo\" dieting, may significantly increase the risk for deadly heart attacks, strokes, and even death. The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore of the New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over five years, recording their weight an average of 12 times. The researchers found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. This narrowing of the coronary arteries decreases blood flow to the heart, potentially causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. Prevention and treatment involve a healthy lifestyle.\n\nPrevious research has linked yo-yo dieting to increased risk of poor heart health. However, new research indicates that the health consequences may be even more severe for individuals with pre-existing coronary heart disease. In a study of 9,509 men and women with coronary heart disease, those who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who experienced little change in body weight. The largest weight fluctuations were linked to 117 percent more heart attacks, 124 percent more deaths, and 136 percent more strokes.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore, found that yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, is defined as repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain. Numerous studies have documented the possible health risks of yo-yo dieting, including a greater risk of death from heart disease. The new research from Dr. Bangalore and colleagues builds on these findings, revealing how yo-yo dieting may impact the health of individuals who have pre-existing coronary heart disease.\n"]}

The incident occurred on April 9, a day after Lois Hicks passed away at the age of 88. According to Vel McKee, Hicks' daughter, an unidentified woman entered the funeral home and stole the ring from her mother's body while the family was briefly away. The theft was captured on surveillance video, which shows the woman entering the building, going to the room where the casket was located, and taking the ring.\n\nThe funeral home's general manager, Bill Vallie, confirmed that the video exists and that the woman was seen parking her car and entering the building before the theft occurred. McKee and her sister had left the funeral home only 15 minutes prior to the incident. The family is devastated by the theft, as the ring was a symbol of Lois Hicks' love and devotion to her late husband, Gayle.\n\nThe Odessa Police Department is currently investigating the incident as a state jail felony. Anyone with information about the woman or her whereabouts is encouraged to contact the police department or Odessa Crime Stoppers. The funeral home has released higher quality video of the suspect and a photo of her vehicle, which is described as a red or maroon 4-door Saturn.\n\nJewelry theft from the dead at funeral homes is not unheard of, but the brazen nature of this incident has shocked the funeral home staff, who have been in operation since 1999.

According to autopsy reports and news sources, Finley suffered a heart attack during the procedure, which was attributed to the sedatives and local anesthesia administered to her. The medical examiner, Dr. Christopher Happy, classified the death as an accident.\n\nFinley had gone to the dentist to receive cavity fillings and root canals. During the procedure, she was given a combination of sedatives, including Demerol, hydroxyzine, and chlorohydrate, as well as laughing gas and a local anesthetic, lidocaine with epinephrine. Immediately following the lidocaine injection, Finley became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\nFinley's parents, Ashley and Evan Boyle, filed a negligence lawsuit against the dentist, Dr. Lilly Geyer, while their daughter was still in a coma. The lawsuit alleges that Finley was not monitored properly during the procedure, and that oxygen levels were not checked every five minutes as required. Instead, they went unchecked for 26 minutes. The lawsuit also states that no CPR was administered when Finley went into cardiac arrest, and that someone had to fetch a doctor from another office.\n\nGeyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, has declined to comment on the allegations due to the ongoing lawsuit. He did not respond to requests for comment on the autopsy report. Geyer was issued a license to practice dentistry in Hawaii in July 2005, and as of last December, there were no records of complaints against her or her practice on file with the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.\n\nIn response to the incident, new state rules took effect in January 2014, tightening oversight of dental sedation in Hawaii.

Ten years prior, Ricks found himself in a crucial position as the forecast coordinator, responsible for conveying the severity of the impending storm. He crafted a bold and unprecedented message, which read, \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE. A most powerful hurricane is expected to make landfall along the northeastern Gulf Coast from Mississippi to Texas late Monday. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks. Perhaps longer. At least one half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail. The vast majority of native trees will be snapped or uprooted. Others will be totally defoliated. Water shortages will make human suffering unimaginable by modern standards.\"\n\nRicks' warning, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, was a stark contrast to the more common, less emotive forecasts typically issued by the National Weather Service. His statement, which was widely circulated and received significant attention, was considered by many to be the most effective and dire weather forecast ever issued.\n\nAt the time, Ricks was aware of the gravity of the situation and the potential impact of his words. He knew that he had one last chance to get the message out to the public before the storm made landfall. He sat down at his desk and, using computers, history, and his fellow forecasters, wrote the warning.\n\nThe images of devastation that emerged the following day made it clear that Ricks' warning was accurate. The storm caused widespread destruction, with many homes and trees being destroyed or severely damaged. Water shortages also became a major issue, leading to immense human suffering.\n\nRicks, who grew up in the Lower Ninth Ward section of New Orleans and had experienced the effects of Hurricanes Betsy and Camille, was deeply affected by the response to his warning.

The research, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan, found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced stage cancer but lived slightly longer without a recurrence due to aggressive treatment. The study is a wake-up call to the medical community, as colorectal cancer has traditionally been viewed as a disease of the elderly.\n\nThe analysis of cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 showed that nearly 15 percent of the 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors were diagnosed before age 50. Younger patients were 30 percent more likely to have tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs.\n\nDespite having more aggressive disease, younger patients had slightly better outcomes. Five-year survival odds were about 95 percent for patients under 50 diagnosed with local tumors, compared to roughly 92 percent for older people. With tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, five-year survival rates were 76 percent for young people and 70 percent for older patients, while with cancers that metastasized to other organs the survival odds were 21 percent versus 14 percent, respectively.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of recognizing symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or pain when going to the bathroom, which can point to the need for diagnostic screening. However, these symptoms are often ignored or ascribed to other conditions.\n\nDoctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs and consider screening for people with a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors at an earlier age than 50. It's unclear whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths, and more research is needed to understand the implications.\n\nThe increase in colon cancer among younger adults is unexplained, and risk factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet may contribute to the trend.

The discovery includes artefacts such as bone and quartz tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, which are the earliest known use of these materials in Australia.\n\nThe findings challenge previous assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The site also contains evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including bones from a giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the earliest known dates for the development of key technologies such as bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and hafted axe technology. The site also provides the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna in Australia.\n\nThe Warratyi site is significant because it is located more than 2,000 km from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeastern New South Wales, making it a much more difficult trek for early humans. The tools have been dated using a couple of estimates, with quartz grains from the site dating to 44,000 years ago, and radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells revealing them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.\n\nThe discovery has been met with controversy, as another site, Carpenter's Gap in the Kimberley region of northwest Australia, has also produced a tiny axe fragment dated to around the same time period.

The military has since focused on destroying over 30 cross-border tunnels that militants have constructed to carry out attacks on Israeli territory. Israel has destroyed most of the 32 tunnels uncovered, but getting rid of the remainder is expected to take a few more days.\n\nThe latest call-up of reservists is intended to provide relief for troops currently on the Gaza firing line, but Israeli officials have also indicated that they may broaden operations in the coming days. Israeli attacks continued on Thursday, with witnesses reporting that munitions struck the Omar Ibn al-Khatab mosque next to a U.N. school in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, damaging water tanks on the roof of a building and sending shrapnel into the adjacent school compound where dozens of Palestinians had taken shelter. At least 15 people were wounded, with three in critical condition.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli tank shells struck a U.N. school in the Jebaliya refugee camp, killing at least 17 people and drawing international condemnation. The military said it was responding to mortar fire coming from the area of the school.

The incident at the Algiers Motel, where three unarmed black men were killed by police, is a notorious example of white police brutality during this time. Kathryn Bigelow's new film, \"Detroit,\" revisits this event, mixing fact with fiction to create a visceral and harrowing portrayal of the night.\n\nBigelow's career took a hit with her 1999 film \"Strange Days,\" which dealt with the murder of a black hip-hop artist by white Los Angeles cops. However, she bounced back with the Academy Award-winning films \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty.\" With \"Detroit,\" she chose to make a historical drama about the Algiers Motel incident, which has been the subject of controversy and debate.\n\nThe film opens with a brief history of the mass movement of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, leading to a majority-black city with a majority-white police force. The early scenes depict the tense climate between the police and citizens, culminating in a riot that forces the evacuation of a revue where The Dramatics were set to perform. Reed (Algee Smith) and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) make the fateful decision to wait out the curfew at the Algiers Motel.\n\nThe centerpiece of the film is the police occupation of the Algiers, which Bigelow depicts in graphic detail. The night is a horrifying experience for the guests, who are subjected to intimidation, torture, and murder by the police. The film raises questions about the functioning-as-designed armature of an inherently racist justice system, as the tactics used by the officers' lawyer to discredit the prosecution's witnesses are familiar and infuriating.\n\n\"Detroit\" is a divisive film that has been criticized for its lack of nuance and insight into the victims' lives outside of the event.

The proposed deal, which would value Tesla at over $70 billion before debt, would be the largest buyout in history. Following Musk's tweet, several independent directors of Tesla's board confirmed that they had met several times over the past week to discuss Musk's proposal.\n\nThe board members, who included Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch, issued a statement acknowledging that Musk had opened a discussion about taking the company private and addressing the funding for such a bid. However, the statement left open the question of whether the board was satisfied that Musk had secured the necessary funding.\n\nTwo board members, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, did not sign onto the statement. Jurvetson has taken leave from Tesla following accusations of sexual harassment. The board's statement also raised questions about the timing of the announcement, as it came after Tesla had filed its 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission but before the information was disclosed to the public.\n\nMusk's announcement caused wild swings in Tesla's stock price, with shares reaching a peak of $368 after the tweets before trading was halted. Trading resumed later in the day, and Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385. However, the deal's structure and financing remain ambiguous, and regulators are likely to be interested in the evidence supporting Musk's claim that funding was secured.\n\nSome experts have raised concerns about the irregularity of Musk's announcement via Twitter and the potential motives behind it, such as influencing the stock price. Tesla is the most shorted stock in the history of the market, and those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement. The deal's success would also depend on Musk's ability to raise the necessary financing for a cash-flow negative company."]}

{"samples": ["In the realm of space exploration and the search for intelligent alien civilizations, several intriguing theories and discoveries have emerged. One such theory, proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, outlines the three stages of galactic expansion for technologically advanced civilizations, known as Type I, II, and III. Type I civilizations harness all the resources of a planet, Type II civilizations utilize all the radiation of a star, and Type III civilizations control all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nRecently, a new paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, has revived Kardashev's model and added an apocalyptic twist. Hooper argues that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's available resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization isolated in the vastness of space.\n\nThe presence of dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, means that stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, becoming unobservable and inaccessible. This poses a challenge for humans and any other civilizations seeking to meet aliens in distant galaxies, as they will need to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible forever.\n\nTo accomplish this, scientists and science-fiction authors have proposed the use of Dyson spheres, colossal structures made of millions of solar-powered satellites that can hover around a star and beam its energy back to a nearby planet. This idea was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in a scientific paper in 1960 and later popularized in science fiction.\n\nAncient extraterrestrial civilizations, millions of years older than humanity, would need enormous amounts of energy, making Dyson spheres an attractive solution. However, creating such structures would require more material than all the planets of a solar system could provide. Instead, practical Dyson spheres would be made from millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, forming a cloud around the star.\n\nThese discoveries and theories continue to fuel the search for intelligent alien civilizations and the exploration of the vastness of the universe.

Swonger later admitted to urinating on the wall next to the reservoir, but officials insisted he urinated in the water based on the video evidence.\n\nThe decision to drain the reservoir sparked criticism from various quarters, with some questioning the necessity of such a drastic measure. Anna Harding, a co-director at Oregon State University's School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, stated that the urine would be highly diluted and posed no significant health risk. City Commissioner Nick Fish, however, defended the decision, stating that any risk was unacceptable.\n\nSwonger granted his first interview to the online news magazine Vocativ, where he denied urinating in the water and expressed regret over the situation. He also criticized the city for wasting water and resources. Swonger and his friends were cited for trespassing and public urination.\n\nThe incident drew national and international attention, with some media outlets mocking Portland for its response. The controversy also fueled the debate over the city's water management, as Portland is required to disconnect its open-air reservoir system from the city water system by the end of 2015.\n\nSwonger's interview revealed that he had recently moved back to Portland from St. Helens and had gone to Mount Tabor Park to skateboard with friends.

Under the terms of the settlement, Magnolia will take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects, address lead-based paint hazards at high-risk homes in Waco, Texas, and educate the public about lead-based paint hazards and appropriate renovation procedures.\n\nMagnolia Homes, which specializes in renovations of older homes while preserving historical design elements, came to the EPA's attention due to their depiction on popular television shows. The firm's renovations were viewed by over 3 million households per episode on Fixer Upper. The RRP Rule requires firms performing renovations for compensation in homes built before 1978 to use specific precautions, including lead-safe work practices, to reduce the risk of exposure to lead.\n\nEPA's review of information obtained with Magnolia's cooperation found evidence of noncompliance at renovations of 33 properties. Among the violations were failure to obtain firm certification from EPA, assign a certified renovator, provide homeowners with an approved pamphlet about lead-based paint hazards, post signs to define the work area, and comply with the RRP Rule's work practice standards.\n\nIn addition to a civil penalty, the settlement includes relief focused on compliance management of Magnolia's own renovation operations, outreach about lead-based paint safety to Magnolia's national audience, and the reduction of lead-based paint hazards in Magnolia's local community.

{"samples": ["In a series of groundbreaking discoveries, scientists have uncovered evidence of advanced toolmaking and cultural behaviors in Africa during the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago. Previously, it was believed that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly emerged during a \"human revolution\" 40-50,000 years ago. However, new research published in the journal Science challenges this view, revealing that these advanced behaviors occurred much earlier than thought.\n\nAt the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, researchers found distinct differences in stone tools from this period compared to older deposits in the area. Older sites yielded large, bulky stone tools such as hand axes and cleavers, while the new sites contained much smaller, standardized pieces such as points and blades. Many of these tools were made on obsidian, which came from great distances, indicating long-distance transport of raw materials.\n\nThe team also discovered bright red ochre pigment with evidence of grinding and cut marks, marking the earliest known pigments used to color rocks in the archaeological record. Together, the glass and ochre represent the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age is characterized by the absence or rarity of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades. The transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent.\n\nThese discoveries suggest that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly \"modern\" things at this critical time period, requiring an understanding of space and time and the transmission of technological skills through successive generations. The \"human revolution\" that made us modern never was, as archaeological evidence for modern behaviors arose much earlier.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to understand the relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago when many species of hominins inhabited the African landscape.

At a rally in suburban Nashville, Tennessee, Trump defended Second Amendment rights and criticized \"gun-free zones.\" He also signed autographs and waved to supporters. Trump, who has a handgun carry permit in New York, said that teachers with guns could have prevented the tragedy and that he would emulate Charles Bronson's character in the film \"Death Wish\" if attacked. Trump argued that mental health issues, not guns, are the root cause of shootings in the US and criticized President Barack Obama's response as divisive. Trump's positions on gun control have evolved significantly over the years, and he once supported the ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods for gun purchases.\n\nMeanwhile, the identity of the Russians who contacted the Trump campaign remains a mystery, with multiple news outlets asking the same question. Trump's comments on gun control and mental health were his most extensive since launching his campaign in June. He received his biggest applause of the afternoon in discussing gun rights and mentioned his New York state handgun carry permit. Trump also defended his tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years, by noting his ability to cut costs and build better roads for a fraction of the cost.\n\nTrump's Democratic opponents, including Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, have been leading him in polls for a potential general election matchup.

One of the most notable features missing from the new devices is the standard 3.5mm aux cable input, also known as the headphone jack. Marketing chief Phil Schiller explained the decision by using the word \"courage,\" stating that Apple was moving on and doing something better for all users. However, this statement was met with widespread mockery on social media.\n\nMany critics argued that the removal of the headphone jack was not an act of courage, but rather an example of hubris, arrogance, or even stupidity. They pointed out that there is no technological excuse for the change, as music does not sound better over a Lightning cable or wireless alternatives like Bluetooth or Apple's proprietary wireless technology used in AirPods. Additionally, the loss of the headphone jack means the end of compatibility with various other devices that plug into the phone's jack, such as Square's credit card dongle and temperature sensors.\n\nFurthermore, users expressed frustration that they would now have to carry an additional accessory, the $9 aux-to-Lightning cable dongle, to use their wired headphones with the new iPhone. Some also criticized the decision for being a step backward, as it forces users to choose between charging their phone and using wired headphones at the same time.\n\nApple's old mantra, \"it just works,\" is no longer applicable, as having any set of headphones work with an iPhone used to be a given. Now, Apple has retreated into its walled garden, and users are required to pay for the privilege of using Apple's proprietary system or face the inconvenience of using wireless alternatives.\n\nIn summary, the removal of the headphone jack from the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been met with widespread criticism and frustration from users.

The airline has updated its boarding process to rely on fewer boarding lanes, reducing congestion and potentially speeding up passenger loading. United started testing the new boarding procedure in June at select gates in Chicago and Houston, and as of this week, it has officially rolled out the new process.\n\nUnder the new system, there will still be five boarding groups but only two lanes for boarding. Elite and priority passengers in groups 1 and 2 will load through lane 1, while customers in groups 3, 4, and 5 will use lane 2. Chase co-branded credit card holders will board in group 2. In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app, allowing passengers to be notified when boarding starts.\n\nThe new boarding lanes and gateside notifications should roll out to airports this week. The simplified boarding process is not unique to United, as American Airlines currently boards by zone using only two lanes, and Delta Air Lines splits the difference and boards with four. However, top-tier elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts with United, while most carriers only offer this perk to VIP passengers.\n\nSeparately, United has announced a joint business agreement (JBA) with Copa, Avianca, and many of Avianca's affiliates. The JBA, pending government approval, is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities, and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America.

New York ordered low-lying hospitals and nursing homes to evacuate, and at least seven states declared emergencies. Irene was projected to make landfall along North Carolina's Outer Banks on Saturday, and could bring tidal surges 5 to 10 feet high and destructive and life-threatening waves. The storm could inundate coastal areas with 6 to 10 inches of rain, and up to 15 inches in some locations. More than 50 million people lived in the projected path of the storm, and it could grow into a Category 4 storm with sustained winds topping 130 mph.

In a demonstration outside Homrich, a company contracted by DWSD to carry out the shutoffs, at least nine activists were arrested for disorderly conduct after temporarily blocking trucks from leaving the company's parking lot.\n\nThe activists, who say the shutoffs are a human rights violation, argue that in a city with a poverty rate of 44 percent and high water bills, Detroit should work out a solution with poor residents instead of leaving them without water. Critics have accused DWSD of being unnecessarily aggressive in pursuing delinquent accounts, with some families, elderly and disabled residents, and even young children losing access to water.\n\nDWSD, which needs to recoup $175 million in outstanding bills, has also been accused of ignoring the debts of large entities while targeting individuals with small balances. The department has announced a $1 million fund for residents struggling to pay, but activists say many others are still at risk of losing access to water over the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, DWSD has also intensified efforts to collect unpaid debts from commercial customers, which make up about 12 percent of the approximately 90,000 accounts that are at least 60 days past due.

Russia had charged Katriuk with genocide in connection with the 1943 killing of civilians in Khatyn and had requested his extradition to Moscow for trial. However, Canada ignored the request and said it would never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine.\n\nKatriuk had been found to have lied about his voluntary service for German authorities during the war in order to obtain Canadian citizenship. In 1999, the Federal Court ruled that he had been a member of a Ukrainian battalion implicated in numerous atrocities, including the deaths of thousands of Jews in Byelorussia between 1941 and 1944. However, in 2007, the Canadian government overturned an earlier decision to revoke Katriuk's citizenship due to a lack of evidence.\n\nA study three years ago alleged that Katriuk was a key participant in a massacre in Khatyn, where he reportedly lay in wait outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee.

Pandas generate significant tourist revenue in several parts of China, including Beijing, which rents them to foreign zoos to capitalize on global fascination with the animals.\n\nDespite their cuddly appearance, pandas can protect themselves as effectively as most other bears. They use their heavy weight, strong jaw muscles, and large molar teeth to defend themselves. However, attacks on humans are rare but can be severe. In 2008, a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who climbed into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. The WWF cautions that a panda bite can be very nasty, although it is mainly used for crushing bamboo.\n\nThe Chinese government and conservation organizations are working to protect the giant panda population and mitigate human-panda conflicts. The incident involving Guan Quanzhi highlights the need for continued efforts to ensure the safety of both humans and pandas."]}

{"samples": ["\nFormer President George H.W. Bush, who led the United States to a swift victory in the Persian Gulf War and oversaw the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union and unification of Germany, passed away on Friday at the age of 94. Bush, who was the last American president to serve in World War II, had a distinguished career before becoming Vice President under Ronald Reagan in 1980 and then succeeding him in the White House in 1988. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, but later found vindication in the success of his eldest son, George W. Bush, who became president in 2000.\n\nBush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, and joined the Navy when World War II broke out, becoming its youngest pilot at the age of 18. He flew 58 missions in the Pacific and was shot down, but was rescued by a submarine. After the war, he married Barbara Pierce and finished his education at Yale, but chose to move to Texas to become a businessman instead of following his family's path to Wall Street. He co-founded Zapata Petroleum and later began his political career as chairman of the Harris County Republican Party.\n\nBush ran for the Senate in 1964 but was unsuccessful, and was then appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations by President Nixon. He went on to hold several other top appointments, including chairman of the Republican National Committee, envoy to China, and director of the CIA. Bush sought the presidency in 1980 and was the leading contender until being overshadowed by Reagan's tax-cut plans. He was eventually asked to be Reagan's running mate and served as a loyal vice president.\n\nBush's shining moment as vice president came after Reagan's assassination attempt in 1981, when he eased the crisis atmosphere without seeming to arrogate power to himself. He ran to succeed Reagan in 1988 and won the nomination, promising a \"kinder and gentler nation\" but also declaring \"Read my lips: No new taxes.\" However, he abandoned this promise and signed a tax-raising measure, leading to a primary challenge from Pat Buchanan and eventual defeat by Clinton.\n\n"]}

Simpson, the former football star and actor, is set to appear before the Nevada Parole Board on Thursday, September 30, in a hearing that could potentially grant him parole and release from Lovelock Correctional Center, where he has been serving a nine to 33-year sentence for armed robbery and other charges since 2008. Simpson, now 70, is currently serving his sentence for a botched 2007 burglary in a Las Vegas hotel, where he and a group of men attempted to recover memorabilia they believed belonged to him.\n\nThe media interest in the hearing is overwhelming, as Simpson was once a beloved figure in American culture, known for his football career, acting roles, and commercials. However, his fame was tarnished in 1994 when he was acquitted of the brutal stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, in what became known as \"the trial of the century.\" The public's opinions on the verdict were largely divided along racial lines, with many African-Americans believing the verdict was fair, while most whites thought Simpson had gotten away with murder.\n\nIn 1997, Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Brown and Goldman in a civil suit brought by their families and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. Simpson's release from prison could potentially allow him to live on his NFL pension, which is estimated to be $25,000 per month, and is protected by law from being touched by the Brown and Goldman families to settle the judgment against him.\n\nAt his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson expressed remorse for the armed heist and told the parole board that he had been a model prisoner during his time in Lovelock.

The new law makes possession of up to 2oz (56.6g) of marijuana a petty offense, eliminating the need for arrests and criminal records. Cultivation of up to five plants is also permitted. The legislation establishes a cannabis licensing authority to regulate cultivation, distribution, and use of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Rastafarians can now legally use marijuana for religious purposes, and tourists with medical prescriptions can apply for permits to buy small amounts of \"ganja.\"\n\nThe passage of this law marks a significant step in Jamaica's long-standing debate over relaxing marijuana laws. For decades, officials have been hesitant to decriminalize due to concerns about violating international treaties and potential sanctions from the US. However, recent changes in drug laws in other countries have emboldened Jamaican officials to explore the potential benefits of the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and innovative pot-derived items.\n\nMarijuana has long been culturally entrenched in Jamaica, consumed as a medicinal herb, puffed as a sacrament by Rastafarians, and sung about in the island's famed reggae music. The new law is expected to generate revenue for the country, which is currently laboring under an IMF loan program.\n\nThe US assistant secretary for counter-narcotics affairs, William Brownfield, acknowledged Jamaica's sovereign decision but reminded the country of its international treaty obligations regarding drug trafficking and criminal organizations.\n\nJamaica is not alone in its efforts to ease marijuana restrictions. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and Colorado and Washington have legalized personal use. Uruguay became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market in 2014, and Argentina decriminalized personal possession under a 2009 supreme court ruling.

Rachel Borch, a 21-year-old woman, was jogging on a wooded trail near her home when she came across a rabid raccoon. The animal charged at her, baring its teeth, and she knew instantly that it was rabid. Borch tried to defend herself but was unable to run past the raccoon due to the narrow path. With adrenaline pumping, she suspended her disbelief and decided to use her hands to hold the animal down, believing she would have the greatest ability to defend herself. The raccoon latched onto her thumb and wouldn't let go, scratching her arms and legs wildly. Borch remembered seeing a puddle on the ground and quickly dragged the still biting raccoon into it, holding its head underwater until it stopped struggling. Borch was then taken to Pen Bay Medical Center for treatment and later confirmed that the raccoon had tested positive for rabies.\n\nIn a separate incident, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands by what was believed to be a rabid fox. The Maine CDC reported that as of June 7, there had been 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes, and skunks, that had tested positive for rabies in 2017. In comparison, 64 animals had tested positive for rabies in Maine in 2016. Heidi Blood, the Hope Animal Control Officer, warned that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it's \"almost 100 percent\" certain there are other animals in the area also infected. Blood also reminded people and their pets to avoid such animals, even dead ones, as the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours. Under Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease.

{"samples": ["A team of scientists, including those from NASA and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), have made significant discoveries about Mars' ancient water history. According to the first passage, they found strong isotopic anomalies and high deuterium enrichment in Martian water, indicating that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. Passage 2 reveals that nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars was once covered by a massive ancient ocean, which was a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometres of water. This evidence, published in the journal Science, challenges the previous belief that water was an erratic presence on Mars and suggests that it was a warm and wet world in its youth.\n\nThe scientists used data from three powerful infrared telescopes - Keck II, Nasa's Infrared Telescope Facility, and the ESO's Very Large Telescope - to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. Martian water contains both standard water molecules and deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. When normal water is lost on Mars, the concentration of deuterium in the remaining water increases, allowing scientists to infer how much water there once was.\n\nThe infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. This discovery suggests that Mars had a global ocean that covered the entire surface to a depth of 137 meters. However, it is believed that the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, covering nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThese findings add to the growing evidence that Mars was once a habitable planet, potentially capable of supporting life. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover, set to launch in 2018, will continue the search for chemical signatures of life on Mars. Additionally, NASA's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent discoveries about Mars' ancient water history provide compelling evidence that Mars was once a"]}

However, the producers eventually settled on Will Smith, 46, and Margot Robbie, a 24-year-old Australian actress who gained attention for her role in \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"\n\nSmith, known for his ability to convince anyone of anything, fits the role of Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con man who takes Robbie's character, Jess Barrett, under his wing. The film, which demands the audience's willingness to fall for the flimflam, marks a departure for Smith, who has spent much of his career glowering as a macho leading man. In \"Focus,\" he is allowed to showcase his charm and charisma, a trait he first displayed in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\"\n\nThe film, which also stars B.D. Wong, Rodrigo Santoro, and Adrian Martinez, follows Nicky and Jess as they navigate the world of con artistry, leading them into swanky peril with wealthy gamblers and race-car moguls. The dapper-con genre, which includes classics like \"The Lady Eve\" and \"The Sting,\" requires the audience to trust no one, and \"Focus\" delivers on that promise.\n\nDirected by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, \"Focus\" marks a return to the relaxed, romantic comedy style of a bygone Hollywood era, with its upmarket glamour and wiles. The filmmakers, who previously tackled sex and treachery in \"I Love You Philip Morris,\" aim to provide a good time for audiences, even earning an R rating for some raunchy wit.\n\nRobbie, who won the role after a long casting process, brings a modern Grace Kelly-esque charm to the film, with her libido on full display and a self-conscious scheming quality.

The ECJ found that Nestl\u00e9 had failed to prove that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, while also dismissing some of Mondelez's grounds for appeal against a 2016 lower EU court ruling. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the trademark agency could preserve protection for KitKat's shape while respecting the judges' ruling.\n\nThe case, which has been closely followed by trademark lawyers, has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. It has also at times featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree's, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988.\n\nThe dispute between the two multinationals has been mirrored by a separate trademark dispute in the British courts, where Nestl\u00e9 objected to Mondelez's trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nThe ECJ's ruling comes after a decade-long fight by Nestl\u00e9 to trademark the shape of the Kit Kat bar, which was opposed by Mondelez. The case saw several appeals and rulings, with the EUIPO initially granting Nestl\u00e9 the trademark in 2012, but this decision was challenged by Mondelez. In 2016, a lower EU court ruled that Nestl\u00e9 had to prove that the Kit Kat shape was distinctive in every EU country, and no evidence was provided for Belgium, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal.\n\nThe Kit Kat, which was first marketed in the UK in 1935, has been a popular snack in Europe for decades.

A study published in the journal Evolution indicates that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are sounds emitted through the skin in the neck area with the beak closed, have evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization, and they suggest that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar abilities.\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Science, used computer simulations to model the vocalizations of extinct dinosaurs based on the anatomy of modern birds. The researchers found that some dinosaurs may have produced low-pitched, closed-mouth vocalizations, while others may have had high-pitched, open-mouth vocalizations.\n\nAdditionally, a team of researchers from the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary discovered fossilized remains of a bird-like dinosaur with a bony structure in its skull that may have been used to produce closed-mouth vocalizations. The structure, which is located in the lower jaw, is similar to the syrinx, the vocal organ in birds.\n\nThese findings offer new insights into the behavior and communication of dinosaurs, challenging long-held assumptions about their vocal abilities. The research also highlights the importance of studying living organisms, such as birds, to better understand the vocalizations of extinct species.\n\nIn related news, a team of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups.

The university was previously blocked from changing the name due to a 1933 donation from the United Daughters of the Confederacy for naming rights. Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos stated that the payment is a positive step for Vanderbilt and allows the university to move forward. The money for the payment was pledged by anonymous donors.\n\nMeanwhile, Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro is seeking to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. The public higher education system endorsed the change last month, but the proposal faces a tougher hurdle when it reaches the Tennessee Historical Commission due to a new law that requires a two-thirds vote to approve changing or removing historical markers.\n\nThe calls to remove Confederate imagery from public places increased after the slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. The shooter, a white man espousing racist views and who posed in a photo with a Confederate flag, has been charged with murder. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam supported removing the Capitol bust of Forrest, who is famous for his exploits as a Confederate cavalry general and amassed a fortune as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis before the Civil War.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention also voted to urge its congregations to stop displaying Confederate flags. Vanderbilt University began referring to Confederate Memorial Hall as Memorial Hall in 2005. The university has a long and complicated history with the Confederacy, and the name change follows a series of changes made over the past year to address diversity.

Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in June for his role in the 2013 bombings that killed three people and injured over 200 others. The defense claims that the continuous media coverage and social media activity among jurors made it impossible for Tsarnaev to receive a fair trial in the city. They also argue that the death penalty is unconstitutional, citing a recent dissent by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Tsarnaev's team plans to appeal on the grounds of prejudicial trial location and insufficient time for a full argument in mitigation.\n\nDespite the sentencing, Tsarnaev's fate will not be decided quickly. Only three of the 340 prisoners sentenced to federal death row have been executed in the last 50 years. Tsarnaev will join this group, becoming the 62nd inmate, and the youngest at 21 years old. The appeals process is expected to take at least 10 years, and possibly longer.

The memo, which was written by Republicans, was voted on along party lines and against making public a competing memo from Democrats. The memo has been a source of escalating partisan tension in Congress, with Republicans arguing it shows wrongdoing by FBI officials and Democrats saying it mischaracterizes intelligence and is an attempt to distract from the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe day before, Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins urged President Donald Trump to keep a public silence on the independent investigation into his campaign's contacts with Russia, following news reports that he sought to fire Mueller.

Wray was asked to flag any factual errors, national security concerns, or material that could put FBI sources at risk. However, neither Wray nor Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was also urged by Gowdy to see the memo, joined Nunes and Wray in the meeting.\n\nThe release of the memo comes as the House GOP grows increasingly suspicious of the FBI and the influence of Trump's allies who want the memo made public.

The researchers, led by Jack Gallant, used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure subtle changes in blood flow to the visual areas of the brain as subjects watched YouTube videos. They then developed a computer model that matched features of the videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity.\n\nThe team was able to reconstruct the videos, albeit in a blurry and dream-like manner, by running the brain activity data backwards through the model. This technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, allowing us to see the scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. Gallant believes that if they can decode the movies people saw, they might be able to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog, like dreams.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that this is just the beginning, and they hope to look at more visual modules in the brain to build better models and achieve higher resolution. They also need really big computers to process the vast amounts of data. Shinji Nishimoto, the study's lead author, stated that this research sheds light on how the brain understands and processes visual experiences.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast and intriguing. It could potentially be used to help people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. Brain waves recorded through electrodes on the scalp can already flip a switch, allowing communication. However, the ethical implications of being able to watch a person's memories or even their thoughts are complex and raise many questions.\n\nThe researchers were also asked about the potential use of this technology in detective work or court cases, but they emphasized that the accuracy of reading faulty memories only provides misleading information.

The sequester is set to affect a wide range of government programs, including border security, airport security, Head Start, public housing support, NASA, special education, the FBI, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the salaries of senators and representatives are not affected by the sequester.\n\nCritics argue that members of Congress are not truly affected by the sequester and will find ways to insulate themselves from its consequences. Meanwhile, congressional staffers and other government employees face the possibility of furloughs and pay cuts.\n\nIn summary, the House of Representatives returned from recess on Monday with only a few items on the agenda before another planned recess and the potential government shutdown at the end of March. The most pressing matter was the implementation of the sequester, automatic spending cuts set to take effect on Friday, March 1. Despite the looming cuts, some politicians and pundits have downplayed their significance, suggesting that Congress would find a way to avoid the worst consequences."]}

Warren accused Stumpf of failing to hold himself and other senior executives accountable for the company's actions and demanded his resignation and the return of his earnings. During the Senate hearing, Warren accused Stumpf of prioritizing cross-selling to drive up stock prices and enrich himself, while employees were pressured to meet quotas and cheated customers. Stumpf denied the allegations, stating that cross-selling was about deepening relationships. Warren, who has not received any donations from Wells Fargo's political action committee, criticized the culture that allowed the scandal to occur and compared it to theft.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump is expected to announce the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital on Wednesday, a decision that has been met with criticism from various parties.

The hack appears to have originated from a breach at post-production studio Larson Studios in late 2016. In addition to \"Orange Is the New Black,\" the hacker also claims to have stolen unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic, and IFC.\n\nNetflix confirmed the breach and described it as an \"active situation\" being investigated by the FBI and other authorities. The company did not comment on the authenticity of the leaked episodes or the hacker's demands. The hacker has reportedly made extortion demands to Netflix, asking for an unspecified sum of money to prevent further leaks. However, it's unclear whether the motive for the hack is financial gain or bragging rights in the cybercrime underworld.\n\nThe hack could have significant consequences for Netflix. The company is counting on \"Orange Is the New Black\" to help it add 3.2 million subscribers from April through June, a substantial increase from its average gain in the same period over the past five years. A dip in subscriber growth could negatively impact Netflix's stock price.\n\nRumors of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, with purported screenshots and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency.

{"samples": ["Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, continues to baffle investigators, with statistical tools providing no definitive answers about its location or cause. However, Bayesian statistics, a method named after 18th century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, can help refine and focus the search by allowing hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane based on new information.\n\nIn 2009, Bayesian statistics were used to locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which had gone missing for two years. The method allows assessing various scenarios, even contradictory ones, and combining them to find the most likely solution. It also allows updating the model with new information.\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is complicated by the fact that it is believed to have been deliberately diverted, making spots farther from the takeoff point in Kuala Lumpur more likely. Bayesian inference formalizes common sense and helps update probabilities based on new information.\n\nThomas Bayes was a British Presbyterian minister born in London in 1702. He studied logic and theology at the University of Edinburgh and became a minister in a Presbyterian chapel. He is best known for his mathematical work on probability, which gave rise to Bayes' Theorem. Bayesian probability estimates are used all over the world, built into software that forecasts events including financial markets and weather. He died in Royal Tunbridge Wells in 1761.\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is ongoing, with a large area in the Indian Ocean being searched. The probability map provided by Bayesian statisticians has given investigators a much tighter area to search, but so far, no sign of the plane has been found. The mystery of the crash may never be solved, as it is very likely that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and will never be found.\n\nEven finding debris might not be helpful, as it could take a long time for the wreckage to surface, and it might not provide much information about the location of the bulk of the plane. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 continues, with investigators hoping for a breakthrough."]}

The explosions, which were heard several miles away and shattered windows of nearby buildings, were caused by a car bomb and an explosive device near the army command buildings, according to an army statement. One Syrian national and correspondent for Iranian Press TV, Maya Nasser, was killed in an exchange of fire following the blasts. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported heavy clashes inside the compound of the army command, with casualties on both sides. Witnesses said rebels may have been holed up inside the army command building. The explosions were the latest in a series of attacks on security sites and symbols of regime power in Syria, which has been embroiled in a civil war for over a year. The conflict, which began in March 2011 with protests calling for political change, has killed nearly 30,000 people according to activists. In July, rebels penetrated the heart of Syria's power elite, detonating a bomb inside a high-level crisis meeting in Damascus that killed three top regime officials. Other large blasts have targeted the headquarters of security agencies in the capital, killing scores of people this year. The situation in Syria was the focus of attention at the U.N. General Assembly's annual meeting in New York this week, with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanding international action to stop the war and calling it a serious and growing threat to international peace and security. However, the U.N.'s most powerful body, the Security Council, has been paralyzed due to deep divisions and Russia and China's vetoes of Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to end the violence and enter negotiations on a political transition. In contrast, President Barack Obama pledged U.S. support for Syrians trying to oust Assad, who he called a dictator who massacres his own people.

The incident occurred at a WinCo Foods store on the 700 block of West Avenue K, where the manager reported a strong odor coming from the column on Saturday afternoon. A plumber and handyman were called to investigate, and upon breaking off some bricks, they discovered a leg and shoe inside.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's homicide detectives arrived at the scene and identified the body as that of a man believed to be a chase suspect who had eluded authorities earlier in the week. The suspect had led deputies on a foot chase on Monday, which ended in a crash. He then managed to escape by running into the supermarket and onto the roof.\n\nDetectives believe the suspect may have tried to hide from the deputies by getting inside the column but was unable to get out. An autopsy is pending to determine the exact cause of death, and it's unclear whether the victim fell to his death or became trapped and couldn't get out.\n\nThe store was closed as the investigation continued, and crews worked to extract the body. The coroner's office later identified the man as Raymundo Rivera, 35.

The United States faces a diplomatically delicate challenge in ensuring the safe evacuation of over 200 American athletes in case of a catastrophic strike. The U.S. military has plans to use two warships in the Black Sea and planes already on standby in Europe for this purpose. However, the success of any American rescue operation heavily depends on the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sees the games as a matter of national pride and has reportedly spent $50 billion on their security.\n\nExperts warn that not only large-scale, coordinated attacks but also lone attackers pose a significant threat to the Games. Russia has taken extensive measures to provide security, deploying about 40,000 law enforcement and special services officers. Some nations, including the United States, have hired private security firms to provide additional protection to their athletes. The U.S. ski and snowboard team has contracted Global Rescue, which will have five aircraft on standby for emergencies and will work with Russian state agencies as necessary.\n\nBritain has also sent security staff as part of its delegation but will rely primarily on the security provided by the Games Organizing Committee and the host country. Several groups, including Vilayat Dagestan, which claimed responsibility for the Volgograd suicide bombings, have threatened to attack the Sochi Olympics. In response, some countries' teams have taken additional security measures.\n\nIsrael, which experienced tragedy at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, is confident that Russian security agencies will provide adequate protection.

Durst, who appeared frail in court, had pleaded guilty to the charge in February and requested to serve his time in a low-security federal prison in Los Angeles while awaiting trial for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. Durst's attorneys cited his advanced age and poor health in their request for him to be housed at FCI Terminal Island, a federal prison with medical facilities near Los Angeles.\n\nDurst, 73, had been held in Louisiana since his March 2015 arrest on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. His arrest came one day before the series finale of an HBO documentary entitled, \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\u201d which chronicled several police investigations of Durst in connection with the dismemberment killing of a male neighbor in Texas in 2003, the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, in New York in 1982, and Berman's death.

The final report of the House Benghazi Select Committee, released on Tuesday, revealed new details about the events leading up to and during the attack. According to the report, State Department officials had concerns about Marines potentially wearing uniforms during the attack due to the potential diplomatic implications. However, this issue did not affect the response time of the military.\n\nThe report also found that the Obama administration provided conflicting public and private statements about the attack in its aftermath. For instance, while Secretary Clinton publicly blamed the attack on a protest and an inflammatory video, her private communications and conversations with foreign leaders indicated that she knew the attack was a terrorist assault.\n\nThe report also criticized Clinton and other officials for not adequately addressing growing extremism in Libya before the attack. Additionally, the report accused Clinton of falsely blaming the violence on the video to deflect attention from the administration's failure to protect American diplomats.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, expressed disappointment with the partisan nature of the investigation and the lack of transparency. He accused the panel's chairman, Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), of withholding information from Democrats and preventing accountability.\n\nThe report's release comes after Democrats on the committee released their rebuttal to the GOP report on Monday.

Her remains were found six weeks later on an abandoned property in Albemarle County.\n\nGarner testified that Shaker detected Graham's scent at an industrial site about a mile from downtown Charlottesville. The dog alerted him to a scent indicating \"fear and adrenaline,\" suggesting that Graham may have been attacked near a mulch pile at the site. The dog also found Graham's scent on the passenger door of Matthew's vehicle, in the doorway to his home, and near a dumpster at his apartment complex.\n\nDefense attorney Doug Ramseur unsuccessfully challenged the search warrant for Matthew's apartment and vehicle, arguing that the search dog's findings were inconsistent with witness accounts and video surveillance evidence, that detectives might have misled a magistrate to obtain the warrant, and that there was not probable cause for police to conduct those searches.\n\nAlbemarle County Circuit Judge Cheryl Higgins ruled that there were no \"instances of deliberate misstatements and reckless disregard\" of the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant.

Egeland, who stood on a prosthetic leg during the hearing, had previously pleaded guilty to fraud charges in the Desert Sun housing scandal in 2009. In the latest case, he had directed his son, Rylan Egeland, then 17, to shoot him in the legs with a shotgun on July 31, 2014, in an attempt to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a bogus disability insurance policy. Egeland had applied for the policy seven days earlier, falsely claiming he had never been arrested or indicted for a felony or misdemeanor in the prior 10 years.\n\nThe shooting was quickly detected, and Egeland was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and interstate failure to pay child support. Prosecutors sought a five-year sentence for the insurance scam, while Egeland's lawyer urged a two-year sentence to be served consecutive to the 10-year sentence he was already serving. U.S. District Judge Anna J.

The biggest increases in obesity among women were seen in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while among men, the biggest increases were in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.\n\nObesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, high-calorie junk food and sedentary lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually. During the 33-year period studied, rates of obesity and overweight soared 28% in adults and 47% in children.\n\nThe problem is not limited to rich nations, with two-thirds of the obese population residing in developing countries. The Middle East and North Africa region saw the highest obesity rates, with more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women overweight or obese. Obesity is appearing at increasingly young ages, with nearly 50% of the increase in children and adolescents worldwide.\n\nThe report notes that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue but a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. The researchers called for a renewed focus on preventing and addressing obesity, particularly in developing countries where the problem is rapidly increasing. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions."]}

The cause of their deaths was later determined to be \"ligature neck compression,\" or strangulation, according to Toronto police. The investigation into their deaths is now being led by the homicide squad.\n\nThe couple, who had been married for over 50 years and had four children and a new grandchild, were discovered by their real estate agent. There were no signs of forced entry and no note left behind. Over the weekend, friends and colleagues paid tribute to the Shermans, describing them as kind, generous, and dedicated to their community.\n\nInitially, police classified the deaths as \"suspicious,\" but multiple media outlets reported that investigators were looking into the possibility of a murder-suicide. However, the Sherman family dismissed this theory, stating that their parents' lives were inconsistent with such rumors.\n\nBarry Sherman, a renowned workaholic, founded Apotex in 1974 and had a net worth of $4.77 billion. Honey Sherman was a gregarious philanthropist whose causes ranged from higher education to health care to the Jewish community. The couple were planning a dinner party with friends later this month.\n\nFriends and colleagues described Barry as a dedicated worker who loved what he did, and Honey as a dedicated philanthropist who always got her way. The couple were well-known in Toronto's Jewish community and had handed out millions of dollars to hospitals, universities, and various charities.\n\nThe news of their deaths shocked the community, with many expressing disbelief and sadness. Toronto Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among those who paid tribute to the Shermans. A makeshift memorial was set up outside their home, with flowers and condolences pouring in from the community.\n\nThe investigation into the Shermans' deaths is ongoing, with no suspects at large. Toronto police have asked anyone with information to come forward."]}

The final stage of the vote covered nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates, and was expected to consolidate the gains of Islamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party. The Brotherhood, Egypt's best-organized political force, was on track to win a clear majority of the seats in the full Parliament, which could enable them to govern without forming a coalition and reduce the power of ultraconservative Islamists and liberal parties.\n\nMubarak, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption and conspiring to kill protesters, was on trial alongside his sons, Alaa and Gamal, and former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli. Prosecutor Mustafa Soliman accused Mubarak of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his three-decade presidency to ensuring his son's succession. The trial, which began in August 2011, has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand to remove the presiding judge. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the anti-Mubarak uprising that forced him out of office on February 11, 2011. He could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nThe military rulers, led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, have scheduled the first session of the lower house of Parliament for January 23, two days before the anniversary of the protests that ousted Mubarak. The Parliament is expected to take authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister to run the interim government, but the military rulers have said they intend to retain that authority and allocate very little power to the Parliament.\n\nEconomic growth in Egypt has slowed due to the unrest, which has deterred tourists and investors. Foreign-currency reserves declined by 44 percent to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011, and the benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49"]}
{"samples": ["On Wednesday evening in Mendon, a car driven by Nabila Altahan was suspended from a telephone guy wire after the driver reacted too quickly to her GPS unit's instructions to turn around. The incident occurred around 8 p.m. on Route 4, near Sugar & Spice Restaurant. According to police reports, Altahan had passed her intended destination when her GPS device suddenly gave directions to turn around. In response, Altahan quickly steered the Toyota Corolla off the road and up the wire support of a telephone pole.\n\nFortunately, Altahan and her passenger were not injured in the incident. A witness at a nearby miniature golf course reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. Emergency responders, including State Police and Rutland City Fire Department, arrived at the scene to assess the situation. The cause of the accident is under investigation, but it appears that the driver's overreaction to her GPS device's directions led to the car leaving the road and becoming entangled in the telephone wire."]}
