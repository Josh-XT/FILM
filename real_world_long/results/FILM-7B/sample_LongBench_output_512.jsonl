{"samples": [" This report provides an overview of multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), special contracting mechanisms used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for certain defense acquisition programs. MYP and BBC can potentially reduce weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent compared to the standard annual contracting approach. Congress faces decisions on the frequency of using MYP and BBC, the creation of a permanent statute for BBC, and whether the Coast Guard should adopt these methods.\n\nMYP and BBC differ from traditional annual contracting in that they allow for a single contract to cover multiple years of procurement without the need for annual contract options. MYP requires congressional approval and has a permanent statute (10 U.S.C. 2306b) governing its use, while BBC does not have a permanent statute and can cover more than five years of procurements.\n\nMYP has been used for a limited number of DOD programs, with savings ranging from less than 5% to over 15%. The use of MYP has declined from about 17% of DOD's procurement budget in FY2000 to less than 8% in FY2012. BBC has been used even less frequently, with the Navy using it for the Virginia-class submarines and Littoral Combat Ships.\n\nThe report suggests that MYP and BBC could be used more frequently in the future to increase savings, but this could reduce flexibility for making changes in procurement programs. The report also discusses the possibility of creating a permanent statute for BBC, similar to MYP, to encourage its use and establish clear criteria for its application.\n\nThe Coast Guard, while part of the Department of Homeland Security, is a military service and can use MYP and BBC. The report suggests that using multiyear contracting for the Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter and polar icebreaker programs could significantly reduce acquisition costs.\n\nThe report concludes by summarizing the text of the statute governing MYP and providing appendices with data on programs approved for MYP since FY1990 and the text of the statute."]}

The report examines the inventory, aircraft status, initial operational capability, and service life forecast for each of the 12 selected aircraft. It highlights the importance of DOD policy, which requires services to develop and implement sustainment strategies, such as Life-cycle Sustainment Plans, for maintaining weapon systems. The report also discusses the various DOD offices involved in sustaining fixed-wing aircraft, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness.\n\nThe report identifies that 6 of 12 aircraft experienced decreased availability between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, with 9 of 12 not meeting their associated availability goals in fiscal year 2016. It also notes that O&S costs varied over the 6-year period, with some aircraft experiencing increases and others decreases. The report highlights the challenges faced by the Air Force and Navy, including aging aircraft, maintenance, and supply support issues, which affect aircraft availability and O&S costs.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy should clarify the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. It also emphasizes the need for the DOD to ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems.\n\nThe report concludes that the Air Force and Navy face sustainment challenges related to aging, maintenance, and supply support that affect aircraft availability and O&S costs. It suggests that without clarity on whether the DOD instruction and the Navy guidance apply to legacy systems, program officials will not know whether they are required to have a sustainment strategy or are required to update the plan for their respective fixed-wing aircraft. This lack of clarity could jeopardize the sustainability and affordability of each of the programs."]}

The FWS Office of Law Enforcement and NOAA Office of Law Enforcement have budgets and special agents to investigate wildlife crimes, with a focus on preventing illegal import, export, and interstate commerce of wildlife.\n\nThe report details the collaboration between FWS and NOAA with other agencies and nongovernmental organizations to combat wildlife trafficking, including the use of financial rewards for information on illegal activities. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using financial rewards, the laws that authorize the payment of rewards for information on wildlife trafficking, and the effectiveness of these rewards in combating wildlife trafficking.\n\nThe report recommends that the FWS and NOAA should track financial reward information, augment their reward policies, determine additional information to communicate to the public on financial rewards, and review the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards. The report also suggests that FWS and NOAA should consider making more reward information publicly available and review their use of financial rewards to identify opportunities for improvement.\n\nThe report concludes that while wildlife trafficking is a significant global issue, the U.S. government has not prioritized the use of financial rewards as a tool to combat it. The report recommends that FWS and NOAA should consider the use of financial rewards more seriously and make necessary adjustments to their policies and communication strategies to improve their effectiveness in combating wildlife trafficking."]}

{"samples": [" The federal government supports airport infrastructure through various programs and funding mechanisms. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for planning and development of capital projects related to aircraft operations, while airports can assess local passenger facility charges (PFCs) for broader project funding. Tax-exempt bonds and state and local funds are also used for airport improvements. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) is the primary source of funds for most FAA activities, including AIP.\n\nThe AIP was established in 1970 and has since been modified to reflect congressional priorities and the need for airport safety, capacity, and noise mitigation. AIP funding is limited to capital projects and requires a modest local match. The AATF is funded by aviation-related taxes and has been the source of growth in the trust fund's end-of-year balances.\n\nAirports use a combination of AIP funding, PFCs, tax-exempt bonds, state and local grants, and airport revenues to finance projects. Small airports are more dependent on AIP grants, while larger airports are more likely to use PFCs or tax-exempt bonds.\n\nThe AIP funding structure is complex, with formula grants and discretionary funds allocated based on airport type and size. The federal share of AIP funding varies by airport type, with larger airports receiving a lower share. AIP funding is subject to various legislative, regulatory, and contractual constraints.\n\nThe AIP funding level is a key issue in reauthorization debates, with disagreements over the appropriate level of funding and the use of AIP grant assurances. The AIP funding level is determined by the authorization and appropriations process, and changes could impact the program's structure and funding distribution.\n\nThe report also discusses the history of federal support for airport infrastructure, starting with World War II, and the various legislative acts that have shaped the current AIP and AATF programs.

MILCON appropriations are generally available for 5 fiscal years, with funds available for limited purposes after expiration. The DOD has the flexibility to reprogram funds for other projects, but this requires congressional approval for certain amounts.\n\nThe DOD's Unified Facilities Criteria provide technical manuals and standards for MILCON projects, but the GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide suggests that these criteria do not fully incorporate all steps needed for reliable cost estimates. The GAO found that cost estimates for three selected projects were not reliable, as they did not meet the four characteristics of a reliable estimate: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in MILCON funds, with the active component obligating all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion. The DOD reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund shortfalls caused by emergency projects and projects needing additional funding.\n\nThe GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and the Environment work with DOD\u2019s construction agents, military departments, and other offices to improve DOD\u2019s MILCON cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates.

Schools must be certified by the Education Department, accredited by a recognized accrediting agency, and authorized by the state where they are located. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) office ensures schools meet these standards and administer federal student aid funds properly. Schools are required to submit annual compliance audits, which are reviewed by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for quality.\n\nFSA uses provisional certification for initial applicants and schools that do not fully comply with federal student aid requirements. Provisional certification lasts 1-3 years, and schools are subject to more oversight than fully certified schools. FSA regional staff assess schools' capability to administer federal student aid using various sources, including compliance audits, program reviews, and student loan default rates.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, FSA approved most schools for provisional certification and recertification. Denial rates were higher for for-profit schools, while public and nonprofit schools had lower denial rates. FSA staff often work with schools to address compliance issues.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of compliance audits in assessing a school's administrative capability. However, the quality of these audits varies, with the OIG identifying quality issues in some audits. To address these issues, the OIG has taken steps to enhance auditor training and improve the timeliness of quality reviews. The report also mentions efforts to improve the selection of auditors by schools and to update guidance for FSA staff on coordinating with the OIG.\n\nThe report concludes that addressing audit quality could help ensure accurate and reliable information on school administrative capability for Education's recertification decisions.

The report details the allocation and expenditure of ESF assistance for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, with about $544.1 million obligated and $350.6 million expended. The funds were used for project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors, including payments to Israeli fuel companies and a local Palestinian bank.\n\nThe report outlines three development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure, Investing in the Next Generation, and Governance and Civic Engagement, with the largest share of assistance supporting the first objective. The report also discusses the vetting process for PA creditors to ensure they are not associated with terrorism, as per Mission Order 21. USAID made direct payments to PA creditors, totaling about $75 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $70 million from fiscal year 2016 funds.\n\nThe report examines the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza, including payments to PA creditors and the vetting of PA creditors to ensure that assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism.

Small businesses are crucial for job creation, especially in sectors like construction and retail. However, they often struggle to access sufficient capital, leading to concerns about their ability to start, continue, or expand operations.\n\nThe SBLF was designed to address this issue by providing capital to community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. The program was authorized to make up to $30 billion in capital investments in eligible institutions.\n\nThe report examines the supply and demand for small business loans, the structure of the SBLF, and the arguments for and against the program's enactment. Advocates believed the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and create jobs, while opponents worried about potential losses, lack of oversight, and the possibility of the program benefiting TARP recipients without helping small businesses.\n\nThe report also discusses the implementation of the SBLF by the Department of the Treasury and the introduction of bills to amend the SBLF. It highlights the Federal Reserve Board's surveys on small business loan credit standards and demand, as well as the FDIC's data on small business lending.\n\nThe SBLF's performance has been mixed, with some financial commentators questioning the validity of reported lending gains and the program's overall impact on small business lending. The program's costs have been estimated to range from a savings of $80 million to a cost of $6.2 billion, depending on the methodology used.\n\nIn conclusion, the report suggests that while the SBLF aimed to address the decline in small business lending and create jobs, its effectiveness and long-term costs remain subjects of debate.

The Supreme Court has mandated that states eliminate all vestiges of de jure segregation, including through race-conscious remedies, as seen in the 1992 decision United States v. Fordice. This three-step inquiry assesses whether a policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or eliminated without eroding sound educational policy.\n\nVoluntary \"affirmative action\" policies, which aim to increase minority representation, are subject to strict scrutiny by federal courts. The Court has upheld these policies under the diversity rationale, requiring universities to articulate precise and compelling diversity-related goals and demonstrate that their admissions policy achieves these goals as precisely as possible.\n\nThe report also addresses the role of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ensuring equal protection in higher education. Title VI prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, and the Department of Education and the Department of Justice have the authority to enforce these regulations.\n\nThe report concludes by discussing the potential for Congress to amend Title VI to either restrict or expand its scope, and the ongoing debate over the use of race in higher education admissions. It emphasizes that while the Supreme Court has provided some guidance, the role of Congress in shaping the future of affirmative action in higher education remains significant."]}

States must provide a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of these funds, with total program funds reaching $3.81 billion in fiscal year 2016.\n\nWIOA requires state VR agencies to provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities, emphasizing the provision of services to ensure meaningful opportunities for training and support. States must reserve at least 15 percent of their VR allotment for these services. WIOA also mandates coordination responsibilities between state VR agencies and educational agencies to ensure the provision of pre-employment transition services.\n\nState VR agencies have reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment in 2014, with most providing the five required activities to more students. However, challenges in identifying eligible students and coordinating with educational agencies have been reported.\n\nState VR agencies have taken various actions to build their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services, including building staff capacity and expanding contracts with service providers. Despite these efforts, some agencies have not fully utilized the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services, and there is a need for clearer guidance on allowable expenditures.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of Education establish timeframes for providing states with additional information on allowable expenditures, take additional steps to assist states in updating and finalizing interagency agreements, and develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices.

It provides coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. Medicare consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance), Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage). Part A is funded by payroll taxes and covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. Part B is funded by beneficiary premiums and general revenues and covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. Part C is a private plan option that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice, and is funded through the HI and SMI trust funds. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits and is financed through the SMI trust fund, beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfer payments.\n\nMedicare serves approximately one in six Americans, with an estimated 61 million persons covered in 2019. Total Medicare spending in 2019 was about $772 billion, with approximately $749 billion spent on benefits. Medicare is a high-priority issue due to its financial demands on the federal budget and beneficiaries. The program has undergone significant changes since its inception, with laws enacted to control spending and expand coverage.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries are entitled to premium-free Part A if they or their spouse paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters. Enrollment in Part B is voluntary, with a monthly premium. Medicare Advantage (Part C) offers an alternative to original Medicare, with private plans covering all Medicare services except hospice. Part D provides prescription drug coverage, with beneficiaries paying a monthly premium.\n\nMedicare's financial operations are accounted for through two trust funds: the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D.

The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy acknowledges the historic importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting U.S. national interests.\n\nThe report provides a current snapshot of American foreign assistance, illustrating its evolution over time. It includes data from various sources, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Foreign Aid Explorer database and annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations acts. The report also addresses frequently asked questions about the U.S. foreign aid program, its objectives, costs, and organization, as well as its role in Congress and how it compares to other aid donors.\n\nU.S. foreign aid is defined under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 as any tangible or intangible item provided by the U.S. Government to a foreign country or international organization. The scope of U.S. foreign aid has expanded beyond traditional foreign operations and international food aid appropriations, with many U.S. departments and agencies adopting their own assistance programs.\n\nThe report outlines the rationales for foreign assistance, including national security, commercial interests, and humanitarian concerns. It also discusses the objectives of aid, which include promoting economic growth, improving governance, addressing population growth, expanding access to basic education and health care, protecting the environment, promoting stability in conflictive regions, protecting human rights, promoting trade, curbing weapons proliferation, strengthening allies, and addressing drug production and trafficking.\n\nThe report organizes U.S. foreign aid around five strategic objectives: Peace and Security; Investing in People; Governing Justly and Democratically; Economic Growth; and Humanitarian Assistance.

Examples include the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Secure Border Initiative Network program, and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program. These failures are attributed to ineffective management, lack of oversight, and security deficiencies.\n\nTo address these issues, Congress and the President have enacted reform legislation such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). FITARA aims to improve IT acquisitions and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress, while FISMA focuses on improving federal cybersecurity.\n\nThe report highlights the need for agencies to implement FITARA and FISMA provisions, including enhancing CIO authority, consolidating data centers, and managing software licenses. It also emphasizes the importance of CIOs having a significant role in IT planning, programming, budgeting decisions, and execution decisions.\n\nThe report notes that while agencies have made progress in implementing key IT management and cybersecurity initiatives, further efforts are needed to fully address the recommendations made over the years. It concludes that FITARA and FISMA present opportunities for the federal government to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT, potentially saving billions of dollars."]}

Prosecutors in DOJ\u2019s Criminal Division and the Criminal Divisions of the 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) oversee criminal matters, identify victims, determine losses, and negotiate plea agreements that may include restitution. The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section manages the Asset Forfeiture Program, which can be used to collect on unpaid restitution debts. The judiciary orders restitution, and probation officers ensure offenders abide by the terms of release, including paying restitution. The U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) collects data on sentencing decisions, including restitution orders.\n\nThe report analyzes data from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, revealing that restitution was ordered for 15% of offenders, totaling $33.9 billion. However, courts did not order restitution for 85% of offenders. The majority of offenders were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses, which typically do not have victims with actual losses. Restitution was more often ordered for offenders sentenced for fraud.\n\nThe report also highlights the challenges in collecting restitution, with many debts identified as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. The DOJ collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, with half collected on debts imposed during this period. The report recommends that the judiciary ensure that reasons for not ordering restitution are consistently recorded, and that the DOJ develop performance measures and goals for each USAO related to restitution collection. Additionally, the DOJ should gather information on cases where forfeited assets were not used to compensate victims and take action to increase the use of forfeited assets for victim compensation if warranted."]}

The FMAG system, established in 2001, allows state, local, and tribal governments to request federal aid for controlling, managing, and mitigating fires on public or private forest land or grassland that could become a major disaster. Requests for FMAGs can be submitted to FEMA Regional Administrators and must include cost estimates and information about the fire.\n\nFMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which is not contingent on the DRF balance. The cost-share for FMAGs is 75% federal, 25% state, local, or tribal. FEMA reimburses grantees for eligible activities and requires a grant application within 90 days of the FMAG being granted.\n\nTribes have the ability to request FMAGs under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. Tribes with their own fire suppression resources may receive reimbursement from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for their costs related to fire suppression on tribal lands.\n\nFMAGs are not available for fires that begin on federal land, except in certain circumstances such as mixed federal and nonfederal land ownership. In such cases, FMAGs may be available to assist with declared fires if the state has a responsibility for suppression activities under a cooperative agreement with the applicable federal agency, and those costs are not reimbursable under another federal statute.\n\nFMAGs are not generally available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service or any other federal agency engaged in suppression operations. However, FMAGs may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs, such as state and volunteer fire assistance programs or state and private forestry office.\n\nIn summary, FMAGs are a critical tool for federal assistance in managing and mitigating fires on public or private forest land or grassland, with a cost-share requirement and a process for requesting and evaluating assistance."]}

However, this has raised questions about the CRA's scope and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions not subject to APA procedures.\n\nThe CRA defines \"rules\" broadly, but includes exceptions. To determine if an agency action is a \"rule\" under the CRA, courts must consider whether the statement qualifies as a rule under the APA definition and whether it falls within any of the CRA's exceptions. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before they can take effect. If an agency fails to submit a rule, Congress may still use the CRA to overturn the rule, but this practice has been controversial.\n\nGAO plays a significant role in advising Congress on which agency actions are subject to the CRA. GAO opinions on whether an agency action is a \"rule\" under the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect, but they are often treated as dispositive by the Senate.

However, challenges remain, such as the need for accurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) from FFIs, which are often incomplete or incorrect, hindering the IRS's ability to match account information.\n\nThe report highlights that many Forms 8938, which are filed by U.S. persons with specified foreign financial assets, may have been filed unnecessarily due to confusion about reporting requirements. The report also points out that the reporting requirements for foreign financial assets under FATCA overlap with those under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), leading to duplicative filings and increased compliance burdens for taxpayers.\n\nThe report recommends that the IRS develop a plan to mitigate risks with compliance activities due to the lack of accurate and complete TINs of U.S. account holders collected from FFIs, ensure that appropriate business units have access to consistent and complete data collected from Forms 8938 and tax returns, employ a comprehensive plan for managing efforts to leverage FATCA data in agency compliance efforts, and assess factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting.\n\nAdditionally, the report suggests that the Secretary of the Treasury should lead efforts to establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements. The report also recommends that the Commissioner of Social Security should establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements.\n\nThe report concludes that the IRS must address key challenges to fully utilize the information collected under FATCA to improve taxpayer compliance.

The Obama Administration moved away from supplemental appropriations for war-related activities, using the regular budget and appropriation process instead.\n\nThe report discusses the use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding, which has been used for activities viewed as unrelated to war, and the debate over whether it should be exempt from the Budget Control Act (BCA) limits on discretionary defense spending. Critics argue that the OCO account has become a \"slush fund\" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations.\n\nThe report also covers the use of OCO funding for activities such as the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) and the Global Security Contingency Fund. It highlights the challenges of transitioning enduring OCO costs to the base budget due to the Budget Control Act (BCA) caps.\n\nThe report concludes that the current reliance on OCO funding could be detrimental to national security by undermining budget controls, creating insecurity in the defense workforce, and creating long-term uncertainty in defense planning. It suggests that transitioning longer-term OCO expenses to the base budget could be achieved through increased budget caps, targeted cuts in inefficient Defense programs, and increased revenues."]}
{"samples": [" The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a mineral-rich nation with a history of political upheaval and armed conflict, particularly in the eastern region. The DRC has been involved in violent conflicts, including the \"Africa's World War\" from 1998 to 2003, which resulted in an estimated 5 million deaths. The eastern DRC continues to experience violence, with illegal armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military perpetrating acts of sexual violence against civilians.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to disclose the use of four conflict minerals\u2014tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold\u2014in their products. The Act aims to bring greater public awareness of the sources of these minerals and promote due diligence on conflict mineral supply chains to help end human rights abuses in the DRC.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviewed companies' conflict minerals disclosures and found that most companies reported performing inquiries about their conflict minerals' country of origin. However, many companies indicated challenges in determining the country of origin. Almost all companies that were required to conduct due diligence reported doing so.\n\nThe report also discusses the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and neighboring countries, with new population-based surveys conducted in Uganda and Burundi in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The surveys estimated that 12.7 percent of women in both countries reported experiencing sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey.\n\nThe report concludes that while companies have made efforts to comply with the SEC disclosure rule, challenges remain in determining the country of origin of conflict minerals and whether these minerals finance or benefit armed groups. The report recommends that the SEC continue to provide guidance and enforcement to ensure companies exercise due diligence in their supply chains."]}

The report highlights the importance of the State Department in managing the NIV application process, which can take from a day to months depending on factors like the type of visa and the applicant's background. The report also discusses the screening and vetting process, which includes obtaining an approved petition from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for certain NIVs, conducting background checks, and adjudicating the visa application.\n\nThe report notes that the number of NIV applications peaked in fiscal year 2016 at about 13.4 million, but decreased by about 7 percent in fiscal year 2017. The report also examines the trends in NIV adjudications by visa group, applicant's country of nationality, and location of adjudication. It highlights the increase in H-2A visa adjudications due to the demand for agricultural workers and the decrease in student and exchange visitor visas due to the extension of validity periods for Chinese nationals.\n\nThe report also discusses the impact of executive actions and presidential proclamations on NIV screening and vetting, including the implementation of visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain countries. It outlines the steps taken to enhance NIV screening and vetting processes, such as the development of uniform screening standards and the establishment of the National Vetting Center.\n\nThe report concludes by summarizing the key findings and contributions to the report, emphasizing the importance of the NIV adjudication process in maintaining national security and facilitating lawful immigration."]}

It highlights that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recognized 573 Indian tribes as distinct political communities with tribal sovereignty, and these lands vary in size, demographics, and location. Broadband is defined as high-speed internet access that is always-on, and it can be fixed or mobile. Fixed broadband service is provided through various technologies, and mobile broadband is available wherever a customer has access to a mobile wireless network.\n\nThe report emphasizes the importance of broadband access for all Americans, including those living on tribal lands. The FCC has implemented programs to subsidize broadband deployment in areas with low return on investment, and it has created the Connect America Fund to provide subsidies to providers in rural, insular, and remote areas. However, the report points out that the FCC's data collection process, specifically the Form 477, may overstate broadband access on tribal lands due to limitations in data granularity and the lack of consideration of factors such as affordability, service quality, and service denials.\n\nThe report recommends that the FCC develop methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, establish a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data, and obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC\u2019s tribal engagement requirements. The report also suggests that the FCC should work directly with tribes to obtain information to improve the accuracy of its broadband deployment data for tribal lands."]}
{"samples": [" The report examines the regulatory burdens on community banks and credit unions, focusing on the financial regulations they find most burdensome and the actions taken by federal regulators to reduce these burdens. Community banks and credit unions are generally smaller institutions that provide banking services to local communities and have management and board members who live in the local area. They are often defined by their total assets, with many having assets below $1.2 billion.\n\nCommunity banks and credit unions engage in relationship banking, which involves considering both data models and information acquired through long-term relationships with customers. Small business lending is a significant activity for these institutions, with community banks holding almost $300 billion in small business loans as of June 2017.\n\nThe report highlights the Dodd-Frank Act's impact on community banks and credit unions, noting that while some provisions exempt these institutions from certain regulations, others impose additional restrictions and compliance costs. The report also discusses the regulatory burdens associated with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Bank Secrecy Act (BSA/AML), and the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) regulations.\n\nThe report identifies three sets of regulations as most burdensome: HMDA, BSA/AML, and TRID. These regulations are complex and time-consuming to comply with, leading to increased staff time, costs, and delays in mortgage closings. The report suggests that the complexity of TRID regulations has contributed to misunderstandings and unnecessary compliance actions.\n\nThe report recommends that the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) assess the effectiveness of TRID guidance and issue public information on its plans for reviewing regulations. It also suggests that the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) should develop plans for conducting quantitative analysis and evaluations to streamline regulations.\n\nThe report concludes that while federal regulators have taken steps to reduce regulatory burdens, there is room for improvement in the EGRPRA process, particularly in assessing the cumulative effect of regulations and conducting quantitative analyses. The report recommends that regulators should consider these factors to better address the regulatory burdens on community banks and credit unions."]}

FEMA's grants management environment is complex, with 45 active grant programs across 12 categories, and a significant number of stakeholders, including internal officials and external grant recipients. The agency's grants management systems are highly disparate, with 10 primary legacy IT systems that are not interoperable.\n\nFEMA's Grants Management Modernization (GMM) initiative aims to streamline the grants management process by replacing these legacy systems with a single IT system. The GMM program is expected to be implemented by September 2020 and is designed to interface with 38 other systems, both internal and external to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nThe GMM program has faced challenges in tracking progress, maintaining a consistent sprint cadence, and incorporating stakeholder input. It has also experienced delays in awarding contracts and in the transition from legacy systems to GMM.\n\nFEMA has made efforts to address cybersecurity risks, but there are still areas where the program could improve, such as in the assessment of security controls and the development of corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe report recommends that FEMA finalize its organizational change management plan, communicate transition activities to stakeholders, implement changes to document requirements, update the program schedule, define detailed evaluation methods for assessing security controls, approve security assessment plans before conducting reviews, prepare corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, and fully test all security controls.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the importance of implementing leading practices for business process reengineering and IT requirements management to ensure the successful delivery of a modernized IT system for FEMA's grants management processes."]}
{"samples": [" The Clean Water Act (CWA) established the federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction and related activities. Initially, the program provided grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction, with the federal share of project costs reduced from 75% to 55% in 1981. By the mid-1980s, there was debate over the future of the grants program, leading to the 1987 amendments that authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction through a combination of Title II grants and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program (CWSRF). The CWSRF program replaced the Title II program by 1991, with states administering loans for sewage treatment plants and other water quality projects.\n\nIn 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, modeled after the CWSRF, authorizes EPA to make grants to states to capitalize DWSRFs, which states then use to make loans to public water systems.\n\nThe report details the history of appropriations for both wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs, including the practice of earmarking funds for specific projects, which was criticized for undermining the intended purpose of the state funds. The report also discusses the trend of requiring states to use minimum percentages of their allotted funds to provide additional subsidization, and the establishment of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program.\n\nThe report includes a detailed chronology of congressional activity regarding wastewater and drinking water infrastructure funding for each fiscal year since the 1987 CWA amendments, as well as a summary of funding for the wastewater and drinking infrastructure programs since the enactment of the 1987 CWA amendments. It also provides a comparison of total EPA water infrastructure appropriations between FY1986 and FY2019 in both nominal and constant dollars.\n\nThe report concludes with a discussion of the challenges in funding water infrastructure projects, including the high costs of meeting federal regulations and the need for additional funding to address the backlog of projects."]}
{"samples": [" The report by a government agency examines the pricing of consumer products differentiated by gender, such as deodorants, shaving products, and hair care products. It suggests that firms may charge different prices for similar goods based on gender preferences and willingness to pay, leading to price differences. The report analyzes retail price scanner data and online prices for personal care products targeted to men and women, finding that women's versions of personal care products sold at higher average prices in 5 out of 10 product categories. However, the report acknowledges limitations in its analysis, such as the inability to fully observe all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders.\n\nThe report also reviews studies on gender-related price differences in credit and real estate transactions, finding that women generally pay higher interest rates on average than men due to weaker credit characteristics. However, after controlling for other factors, some studies did not find statistically significant differences in interest rates between men and women.\n\nThe report highlights that federal laws do not expressly prohibit businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar consumer goods and services targeted to men and women. However, consumer protection laws prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions. The report also discusses the responsibilities of federal agencies like BCFP, FTC, and HUD in monitoring and enforcing fair lending practices.\n\nThe report concludes that while there are some gender-related price differences, it is difficult for consumers to identify these differences, and few complaints have been collected in federal databases. It also notes that state and local governments have passed laws to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods or services solely based on gender."]}
{"samples": [" The National Inventory of Dams reports that as of January 2016, there are approximately 90,500 dams in the United States, with about 2,100 associated with hydropower projects. These dams account for about 8% of the total electric generating capacity in the U.S. Hydropower projects are owned and operated by both federal and non-federal entities, with the Federal Power Act providing regulatory jurisdiction over non-federal hydropower projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses and oversees these projects to ensure safe operation, with licensees responsible for dam safety and continuous maintenance.\n\nFERC's approach to dam safety oversight includes hazard classification, regular inspections, technical analyses, and project relicensing. Licensees must have a safety program, and FERC requires regular safety inspections, independent consultant inspections, and potential failure mode analyses for high hazard dams. During relicensing, FERC evaluates safety, environmental, and other factors, requiring licensees to conduct engineering studies related to dam performance.\n\nFERC's inspection process includes document review, field inspections, and discussion of findings with licensees and supervisors. The agency uses multiple systems to record inspection information, which can limit the usefulness of the data. FERC plans to improve consistency by replacing the OEP-IT system with a new system to track dam safety requirements.\n\nFERC's approach to engineering studies of dam performance involves reviewing studies and applying professional judgment to ensure dam safety. FERC's review process is risk-based, with the frequency of reviews depending on the dam's hazard classification. FERC also uses a multi-layered safety approach, including inspections, studies, and assessments of individual dams.\n\nFERC's enforcement actions to ensure compliance with safety regulations include issuing penalties, stop work orders, and license revocations. The agency's approach emphasizes preventative strategies and open communication with licensees to encourage compliance.\n\nThe report recommends that FERC provide standard language and procedures for recording inspection information to facilitate analysis of safety deficiencies across its portfolio of regulated dams. The report also suggests that FERC use information from its inspections to assess safety risks across its portfolio to identify and prioritize safety risks"]}

The fund is primarily financed by an excise tax on coal, with additional revenue from the general fund of the Treasury when necessary. The tax rates on coal have declined since 2019, which may strain the trust fund's finances. The report discusses the history of the federal black lung program, the BLDTF's revenues, and policy options to improve the fund's fiscal outlook.\n\nCWP is an interstitial lung disease caused by inhaling coal dust, leading to scarring of lung tissue and affecting lung function. Despite safety measures, CWP persists among American coal miners, especially in the Appalachian region. The federal Black Lung Program was established in 1969 to provide benefits to miners and survivors when coal operators fail to pay. The program has evolved over time, with Part C benefits now paid by the federal government when no responsible operator exists.\n\nThe BLDTF's primary revenue source is the coal excise tax, which has historically not generated enough revenue to meet obligations, leading to borrowing from the general fund. The report examines the impact of declining coal production, increased rates of CWP, and coal sector bankruptcies on the trust fund's finances.\n\nThe report also discusses the eligibility criteria for benefits, which include total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment. The BLDTF pays benefits to miners and survivors, with the amount based on the number of dependents.

Its economy has been contracting since 2005, with real GDP falling by over 9% from 2005 to 2016. The population has also declined by 12.8% from 2004 to 2017, and the employment-to-population ratio is lower than the U.S. average. Puerto Rico's government has operated with a deficit since 2002, and its total public debt has grown to 66% of GDP and 99% of GNP by 2014. The government has defaulted on over $1.5 billion in debt since 2015, leading to the enactment of PROMESA in 2016, which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico.\n\nFactors contributing to Puerto Rico's financial condition and debt include persistent deficits, inadequate financial management, policy decisions, and a prolonged economic contraction. The government has issued debt to finance operations, and high demand for Puerto Rico debt has been facilitated by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico.\n\nTo address these issues, the report suggests federal actions that could help, such as ensuring timely disclosure of financial information by municipal issuers, subjecting Puerto Rico investment companies to the Investment Company Act of 1940, and removing the triple tax exemption for Puerto Rico\u2019s municipal securities. These actions are non-fiscal in nature and aim to increase transparency, protect investors, and reduce the demand for Puerto Rico debt.\n\nThe report also highlights the Puerto Rico government's plans to implement an integrated new information technology system for financial management, develop a new public healthcare model, and collaborate with the private sector for infrastructure and service projects.\n\nThe report concludes that while federal actions can help address some factors contributing to Puerto Rico's financial condition and debt levels, the Puerto Rico government must also take action to improve its fiscal governance and accountability."]}

CMS has designated Medicare and Medicaid as high-risk programs due to their size, scope, and complexity, which make them vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\nCMS receives appropriations for antifraud activities through various funds, including the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program and the Medicaid Integrity Program. In 2016, CMS received $560 million through the HCFAC program and $75 million annually through the Medicaid Integrity Program.\n\nFraud can take many forms, including billing for services not provided or not medically necessary, and can have nonfinancial effects such as patients receiving harmful or unnecessary services. Fraud risks can exist even if fraud has not yet been identified or occurred.\n\nCMS has established the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) to address fraud, waste, and abuse across its programs. CPI focuses on program-integrity activities, including fraud control activities, and works with a network of stakeholders to manage fraud risks. CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as through data analytics and prior authorization for certain services.\n\nThe Fraud Risk Framework provides a comprehensive set of key components and leading practices for managing fraud risk. CMS's antifraud efforts partially align with the framework, but the agency has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nCMS has increased its program-integrity obligations and resources over time, but there is a need for more comprehensive fraud risk management.

Factors contributing to these changes include military involvement in conflicts, conversions from military to civilian and contractor roles, contractor insourcing, and growth in certain workforces like acquisition and cyber. DOD's workforce management is governed by several statutes, including sections 129, 129a, and 2463 of Title 10 of the United States Code. These sections direct the management of DOD civilian personnel, the establishment of policies for determining the most cost-efficient mix of military, civilian, and contracted services, and the use of DOD civilian employees for new functions.\n\nDOD Instruction 1100.22 outlines policy and procedures for determining the appropriate workforce mix. Over the past decade, DOD has improved its methodology for estimating and comparing the full cost of work performed by military, civilian, and contractor personnel. However, limitations remain, such as the lack of guidance for certain cost elements related to overhead.\n\nThe DOD's Cost-Comparison Report addressed three elements and partially addressed one concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel. The report concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominantly more or less expensive, with costs varying by function, location, and level of expertise.\n\nThe report also assessed the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. It found a variance in the authorities used between organizations, management unfamiliarity with all available authorities, and a belief among managers that expanded use of some authorities is needed to produce more quality hires.\n\nThe report recommends that DOD and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) should explore opportunities to refine, consolidate, or reduce unused, inefficient, or cumbersome hiring authorities.\n\nIn summary, the DOD's workforce has seen changes in size and composition due to various factors, and the department has made efforts to better understand and manage its workforce costs.

It also addresses the issue of the Navy's decision to show CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 instead of FY2019, which affects the comparison of ship procurement numbers and the aircraft carrier procurement profile.\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the Navy's decision to not accelerate the scheduled procurement of CVN-82 and the implications for the Navy's 12-ship force-level goal. It also touches on the Navy's efforts to complete the construction, testing, and certification of the weapons elevators on CVN-78, which have been delayed due to technical issues.\n\nThe report concludes by summarizing the Navy's testimony and the GAO's testimony on the CVN-78 program, highlighting the challenges faced and the steps taken to address them. It emphasizes the importance of the CVN-78 program in maintaining the Navy's carrier force and the need for continued oversight to ensure cost and schedule performance improvements."]}
{"samples": [" The report by a government agency focuses on risk management for federal facilities, particularly in the context of security. It highlights the establishment of the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) in 1995 following the Oklahoma City bombing, which mandates enhancing security and protection of federal facilities. The ISC has developed standards, including the ISC Standard, to guide risk assessments and countermeasures. However, the report finds that most federal departments and agencies do not fully align their security assessment methodologies with the ISC Standard.\n\nThe report examines four agencies: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service. It identifies that none of these agencies' methodologies consider all undesirable events, assess threats, consequences, or vulnerabilities consistently, and do not document deviations from the ISC Standard. This lack of alignment can lead to inappropriate levels of protection, unnecessary resource use, and inability to make informed resource allocation decisions.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges agencies face in conducting timely assessments, such as competing priorities and insufficient staff. It highlights the need for agencies to update their policies and procedures to align with the ISC Standard, collect and analyze data for monitoring, and implement long-term assessment schedules.\n\nThe report concludes with recommendations for each agency to improve their physical security programs, including updating policies, revising assumptions for backlog plans, and implementing long-term assessment schedules. The agencies have agreed with the findings and provided actions and timeframes for completion."]}
{"samples": [" The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) requires federal agencies to estimate improper payment rates for susceptible programs and activities. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate. The PERM measures errors in FFS claims, managed care payments, and eligibility determinations. However, it does not account for overpayments to providers or unallowable MCO costs, which are significant risks in Medicaid managed care.\n\nThe PERM's methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the HHS-OIG conducts annual compliance reviews. Despite CMS's efforts to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care, the PERM's improper payment rate may understate the extent of program integrity risks.\n\nThe report highlights that the PERM's 0.3 percent improper payment rate for Medicaid managed care is lower than the 12.9 percent rate for Medicaid FFS, but this does not necessarily indicate better oversight. The PERM does not account for unidentified overpayments and unallowable costs, which can inflate future capitation rates and lead to higher state and federal spending.\n\nCMS has taken steps to improve oversight, such as updating regulations, conducting Focused Program Integrity Reviews, and engaging in collaborative audits. However, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable costs.\n\nThe report recommends that the Administrator of CMS consider mitigating program risks not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs. The report also suggests that the PERM likely underestimates program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care and that CMS needs better information about these risks to target program integrity activities effectively.\n\nThe report concludes that without better measurement of program risks, CMS cannot be certain that the low improper payment rate for managed care accurately reflects lower risks in managed care. The report recommends that CMS consider revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care to ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program."]}

End products must be manufactured in the U.S. or have a majority of components made domestically to be considered domestic. Exceptions to the Act include situations where domestic products are not available or the cost is unreasonable. The Act also allows for waivers under international trade agreements, with certain countries and products exempted.\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) sets forth exceptions and waivers, and agencies can make blanket determinations for certain countries. The Department of Defense (DOD) has reciprocal procurement agreements with 27 countries, exempting their products from the Act's restrictions. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 allows waivers for countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements.\n\nThe Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) is used to report contract awards and obligations, including the use of Buy American exceptions and waivers. However, there are system limitations and data reporting errors, leading to incomplete and inaccurate information.\n\nThe report found that in fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for the acquisition of foreign end products, which accounts for less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations. The report also found that agencies may not always input reliable information on the extent to which exceptions or waivers authorized the acquisition of foreign end products.\n\nThe report recommends that the Office of Management and Budget, DHS, VA, and HHS provide additional training and guidance to improve the understanding of the Buy American Act requirements and to ensure accurate data reporting.

The total number of beneficiaries decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, while total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion.\n\nThe RRA authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families, with the average monthly benefit for each beneficiary being about $1,986 in 2017. The program is financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Payroll taxes are divided into Tier I and Tier II taxes, with Tier II taxes used to finance Tier II benefits and supplemental annuities.\n\nTo be insured for railroad benefits, a worker must generally have at least 10 years of covered railroad work or 5 years performed after 1995 and \"insured status\" under Social Security rules. Beneficiaries insured by both systems receive a single check from the RRB. Railroad retirement annuities may also be reduced for certain pensions earned through federal, state, and local government work that is not covered by Social Security.\n\nThe RUIA provides for daily unemployment and sickness benefits, financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes. Eligibility for these benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable is $77, with a maximum biweekly benefit of $770.

However, the exact number of people displaced by climate change is uncertain due to the multi-causal nature of migration and limited data.\n\nClimate change can add complexity to migration decisions, with people considering economic, political, social, personal, and demographic factors. The U.S. government agencies involved in responding to climate change-related migration include State, USAID, and DOD. These agencies have discussed climate change's effects on migration in their adaptation plans and risk assessments, but there is no clear guidance on assessing climate change as a driver of migration.\n\nExecutive actions related to climate change have varied between administrations, with the previous administration issuing executive orders focused on improving climate preparedness and resilience, while the current administration revoked some of these actions.

The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly address emergency powers, leading to varied responses over time. In the 19th century, presidents often acted without congressional approval, while in the 20th century, Congress began to create statutory bases for emergency declarations. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 was enacted to limit the expansive emergency economic powers granted to the President under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA).\n\nThe report highlights the increasing delegation of emergency powers to the executive, a trend seen in liberal democracies. It examines the use of IEEPA, which grants the President extensive power to regulate economic transactions during a state of emergency. The report also discusses the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, which requires the President to continue using IEEPA for certain export controls.\n\nThe report notes that while IEEPA was initially enacted to limit presidential emergency authority, its use has expanded in scale, scope, and frequency. Presidents have invoked IEEPA in 54 declarations of national emergency, with most lasting nearly a decade. The report suggests that Congress may wish to address issues related to how it has delegated its authority under IEEPA and the NEA, as well as choices made in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.\n\nThe report concludes by noting that despite criticisms of IEEPA, Congress has not acted to terminate or express displeasure with an emergency declaration invoking IEEPA, which may indicate congressional approval of presidential use of IEEPA. The report suggests that Congress could consider amending IEEPA to include a \"sunset provision\" or a review mechanism to give Congress an active role in overseeing the use of IEEPA."]}

However, pipelines are vulnerable to physical attacks and cyber threats, with the latter increasing in frequency and sophistication. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has primary oversight responsibility for pipeline security, issuing guidelines and conducting reviews. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) assists with cybersecurity incidents, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) regulates pipeline safety.\n\nThe report highlights the need for a strategic workforce plan to ensure TSA has the necessary skills and competencies to conduct security reviews effectively. It also recommends updating the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to include current data and better align with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). The report suggests that TSA should coordinate an independent, external peer review of the risk assessment tool and develop performance measures with measurable targets and baseline and trend data.\n\nThe report concludes that TSA should take steps to improve the quality of its pipeline security program data, including documenting data entry and verification procedures, implementing standardized data entry formats, and correcting existing data entry errors.

Long-term care services, particularly those provided in home and community settings, are more costly than other types of care. Medicaid programs may cover certain medical and non-medical services provided by assisted living facilities, but they do not cover room and board charges. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and states share oversight responsibilities for Medicaid programs, with CMS overseeing state programs and states administering them.\n\nHCBS waiver programs, which serve beneficiaries eligible for institutional care, have the most stringent federal requirements. CMS oversees these programs by reviewing applications and reports, ensuring states have safeguards in place to protect beneficiaries' health and welfare. However, less is known about the oversight and quality of care in assisted living facilities, as states set their own licensing and oversight requirements.\n\nIn 2014, state Medicaid agencies reported spending about $10 billion on assisted living services, representing 12.4% of the $80.6 billion spent on HCBS in all settings. More than 330,000 Medicaid beneficiaries received these services, with an average spending of about $30,000 per beneficiary. The report also discusses the varying approaches states take to oversee assisted living services, including delegating administrative responsibilities to other agencies.\n\nThe report identifies limitations in CMS's oversight of approved HCBS waivers, including unclear guidance on reporting program deficiencies, lack of requirements for states to report on critical incidents, and inconsistent enforcement of the requirement for states to submit annual reports. It recommends that CMS provide clear guidance on reporting deficiencies, establish standard reporting requirements for critical incidents, and ensure timely submission of annual reports.\n\nThe report also discusses challenges Medicaid beneficiaries face in accessing assisted living services, such as limited facilities accepting Medicaid, program enrollment caps, and the inability to pay for room and board.

The Coast Guard is encouraged to assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents as needed.\n\nThe report also calls for improved transparency of data on mission performance, recommending that future Coast Guard Annual Performance Reports (APRs) be made publicly available on the Coast Guard\u2019s public website. Lastly, it emphasizes the need for improved capital planning transparency, suggesting that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition Plan to better understand affordability challenges and make informed tradeoff decisions."]}

The fund, authorized to receive $900 million annually, primarily accumulates revenues from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), the federal motorboat fuel tax, and surplus property sales. However, these revenues are only available if appropriated by Congress. The LWCF also receives additional revenue from OCS leasing under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA), which are mandatory appropriations.\n\nSince its inception, the LWCF has accrued $40.9 billion in total revenues, but less than half have been appropriated through FY2019, leaving an estimated unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion. The fund is allocated for federal and state purposes, with at least 40% for federal purposes and 40% for state financial assistance. The majority of appropriations have been for federal land acquisition, with the state grant program receiving the second-largest portion.\n\nOver the years, there has been debate over the extent to which the LWCF should fund purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states. Some measures have been introduced to authorize funding from the LWCF for various other purposes, but none have been enacted. The report details the other purposes for which LWCF appropriations have been provided, including facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and wildlife conservation programs.\n\nThe report also highlights that since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs, along with a third grant program funded prior to FY2008\u2014FWS State and Tribal Wildlife Grants\u2014have received more than three-quarters of the total appropriations for other purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, the LWCF has been a significant source of funding for outdoor recreation and land conservation, but its use for other purposes has been a subject of debate and legislative action.

{"samples": [" Since January 2017, the U.S. Navy has experienced four significant mishaps at sea, resulting in serious damage to Navy ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these mishaps involved ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy has reduced its fleet by 17 percent since 1998, but the number of ships deployed overseas has remained constant, leading to increased deployment lengths and reduced training and maintenance periods. This has resulted in declining ship conditions and increased maintenance times, compressing the time ships are available for training and operations.\n\nTo meet operational demands, the Navy has assigned more ships to overseas homeports, doubling the percentage of the fleet assigned to overseas locations since 2006. However, this approach has led to higher operational and support costs and challenges in maintaining crew training and ship maintenance. The Navy has also made changes to its process for determining ship crew sizes, which may be contributing to sailor overwork and safety risks.\n\nThe Navy has implemented a revised operational schedule, the optimized fleet response plan, to address low readiness levels. However, challenges in completing maintenance on time and the high demand for naval presence continue to hinder readiness recovery efforts. The Navy plans to grow its fleet by 30 percent, but it has not yet demonstrated the ability to adequately man, maintain, and operate the current fleet.\n\nThe report recommends that the Navy reassess the factors used in its manpower requirements process, develop criteria to reassess the factors used in its manpower requirements process, and update its ship manpower requirements. It also suggests that the Navy should develop a comprehensive assessment of the long-term costs and risks associated with overseas homeporting.\n\nThe report concludes that the Navy needs to address its maintenance, training, and other challenges, and that continued congressional oversight will be necessary to ensure progress in these areas."]}
{"samples": [" The digital economy refers to various economic activities conducted over the internet, which have been subject to selective taxation by some jurisdictions, primarily in Europe. Digital services taxes (DSTs) aim to ensure multinational corporations (MNCs) pay their \"fair share\" of taxes, tax profits derived from consumers in their jurisdictions, or adapt traditional taxation rules to new business models. However, the U.S. opposes these unilateral taxes, arguing they are political efforts targeting U.S. corporations.\n\nDSTs are often justified by the ability of digital MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence in the customer's country and to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The concept of \"permanent establishment\" is crucial, requiring a substantial connection between a corporation's activities and a country to establish taxation rights. However, the internet's global nature complicates this, as digital activities may not trigger physical presence criteria.\n\nTransfer pricing rules dictate how profits from transactions between related entities within an MNC are divided among multiple countries for tax purposes. MNCs can use sophisticated transfer pricing strategies to reduce their effective tax rate on cross-border income, especially in the digital economy where intangible assets are often involved.\n\nConcerns over MNCs avoiding corporate income taxes have led to discussions and proposals for DSTs in Europe. The European Commission's 2015 BEPS Action Plan acknowledges the challenges of taxing the digital economy and discusses potential new tax principles. The OECD's Task Force on the Digital Economy continues to work on these issues.\n\nDST proposals in Europe share features of digital taxation options discussed in the BEPS report. The European Commission argues that existing tax rules do not account for user-created value in the digital economy, leading to a mismatch between where value is created and where taxes are paid.\n\nThe UK, France, and Spain have introduced or proposed DSTs, with varying thresholds and rates. Critics argue that DSTs are not structured as taxes on corporate profits and could be regressive, potentially reducing consumer welfare and increasing deadweight loss. DSTs also present administrative challenges and could violate international trade agreements.\n\nThe report concludes that DSTs are not structured as taxes on profits and could introduce distortions in various markets.

{"samples": [" The report discusses the complex relationship between commercial speech and the First Amendment, particularly focusing on disclosure provisions that require commercial actors to provide certain information to consumers. The First Amendment generally protects the right to free speech, but courts have historically allowed for government actions that compel commercial disclosures without violating the First Amendment. This is because commercial speech has traditionally received less protection under the First Amendment than other forms of speech.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld some commercial disclosure requirements that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech, but if the disclosure provision regulates \"speech as speech,\" it may be subject to intermediate scrutiny or rational basis review. The Court has also suggested that in certain circumstances, disclosure requirements may be subject to heightened scrutiny.\n\nThe report reviews the legal frameworks for analyzing the constitutionality of commercial disclosure requirements, including the Central Hudson test and the Zauderer standard. The Central Hudson test requires the government to prove that its interest is substantial and that the regulation directly advances that interest without being more extensive than necessary. The Zauderer standard is more lenient, allowing for the upholding of commercial disclosure requirements if they are reasonably related to the government's interest in preventing deception of consumers.\n\nThe report also discusses the shifting role of content neutrality in commercial speech doctrine, noting that disclosure requirements are generally considered content-based. However, the Supreme Court has suggested that content neutrality might be relevant in the commercial sphere, and that commercial speech may lose its commercial character if it is inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech.\n\nThe report concludes by suggesting that when Congress and federal agencies consider adopting new commercial disclosure requirements, they should develop a record with more evidence demonstrating a need for the regulation. Courts will examine the government's asserted purpose for the legislation, how closely tailored the disclosure requirement is to achieve that purpose, and whether the government considered alternative policies that would be less restrictive of speech."]}

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) oversees the CAPTA state grant program, requiring states to submit plans detailing how they will use CAPTA funds to improve their child protective services. In 2017, Congress allocated about $25 million for the program. States must also submit annual data reports on child abuse and neglect cases and preventive services.\n\nCAPTA mandates that state governors assure the enforcement of laws addressing the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse. Healthcare providers are required to report such infants to Child Protective Services (CPS), which then assesses the situation and develops a plan of safe care.\n\nThe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016 amended CAPTA provisions related to substance-affected infants. CAPTA also requires states to have mandated reporter laws for child abuse and neglect. CPS typically conducts investigations, offers services, and develops case plans for families.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has led to a significant increase in the number of substance-affected infants, with NAS rates rising from 1.2 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 5.8 per 1,000 in 2012. States have varying policies on reporting substance-affected infants to CPS, with some requiring notification for both legal and illegal opioid use, while others only require notification for illegal use.\n\nDespite these policies, challenges remain, including the definition of \"substance-affected,\" the content of plans of safe care, and the balance between providing necessary support and maintaining confidentiality. States have reported a need for more guidance and assistance from ACF to better understand and implement CAPTA requirements.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of HHS direct ACF to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address these challenges and enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements.

The Department of Defense (DOD) requires each military service to establish its own EFMP, which includes identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support components. The Office of Special Needs (OSN) oversees the policy and collaborates with services to standardize EFMP components.\n\nThe EFMP faces challenges in providing consistent support across services and locations. Variations in family support practices and requirements for family support personnel lead to inconsistent assistance for families with special needs. The Marine Corps, for example, requires quarterly contact with families, while the Navy assigns service levels based on needs. The Army has no specific contact requirements.\n\nThe EFMP also struggles with the development and maintenance of Service Plans (SPs), which document necessary services and support for families with special needs. The number of SPs is relatively low compared to the number of servicemembers and family members enrolled in the EFMP. Reasons for this include varying needs assessments, lack of staff, and the absence of a standardized form approved by DOD.\n\nThe DOD has not developed common performance measures to track the progress of the EFMP's implementation or to assess the effectiveness of each service's procedures. The OSN relies on each service to determine the sufficiency of funding and resources for family support. However, there is no standard for determining the adequacy of these programs, and the DOD lacks a systematic process to evaluate the results of monitoring activities.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the OSN to assess the extent to which each service is providing sufficient resources for family support providers and developing services plans for each family with special needs. It also recommends the development of common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support and the implementation of a systematic process for evaluating the results of monitoring activities.\n\nThe report concludes that without a systematic process to evaluate the EFMP's effectiveness, some families with special needs may not receive the assistance they require, particularly during relocations.

The observatory segment includes the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft, with a sunshield and cryocooler to protect instruments from heat. JWST will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket and requires 22 deployment events to prepare for normal operations.\n\nThe project has faced numerous risks and technical challenges, leading to schedule and cost overruns. To manage these risks, schedule and cost reserves have been allocated to specific activities and elements. The project has also undergone replans in 2011 and 2018, with Congress placing an $8 billion cap on costs.\n\nThe project has experienced significant schedule delays and cost increases, with a history of technical and workmanship errors. To address these issues, the Independent Review Board (IRB) made 31 recommendations, including conducting an audit to identify potential design flaws, establishing corrective actions for human mistakes, and augmenting integration and test staff. NASA has accepted these recommendations and begun implementing actions.\n\nThe project's new schedule reflects the hardware integration and test challenges, with a revised launch readiness date of March 2021.

The CRA applies to banks with deposits insured by the FDIC and is administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC.\n\nThe CRA has been debated for its impact on lending activity, with concerns that it may encourage banks to forgo profitable lending opportunities in non-targeted neighborhoods and make loans to higher-risk borrowers. The CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers is a subject of congressional debate.\n\nThe CRA examination includes delineating assessment areas, evaluating qualifying activities under lending, investment, and service tests, and calculating a composite CRA rating.

Established by the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC's mission is to ensure access to communication services without discrimination and at reasonable charges. The agency is led by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with one designated as chairman. The FCC is structured into seven bureaus and ten offices, each with specific responsibilities, such as consumer protection, enforcement, international relations, and policy development.\n\nThe FCC's strategic goals, outlined in its five-year plan, include closing the digital divide, promoting innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and reforming the FCC's processes. The agency's budget is funded through regulatory fees collected from license holders and other entities, with the exception of governmental entities and certain non-commercial entities.\n\nThe FCC's operations and goals have evolved over time, reflecting changes in leadership and regulatory philosophies. For example, the net neutrality debate has highlighted contrasting views on regulation and market efficiency. The FCC's structure and strategic goals have also been influenced by changes in the political majority of the commission and the chairman's party.\n\nIn 2019, the FCC eliminated the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis and replaced it with the Office of Economics and Analytics, reflecting a shift towards economic analysis and data-driven policy-making.

{"samples": [" The report discusses the evolution of emergency powers in the United States, from their first expressions during the Revolutionary War to the current statutory framework established by the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Emergency powers have been a concern for political theorists and have been exercised by Presidents at their discretion, with some powers being statutory delegations from Congress that become operative upon a national emergency declaration. The report highlights the differing views of Presidents like Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft on the extent of presidential emergency powers and the influence of constitutional interpretation on the invocation of these powers.\n\nThe report also examines the historical use of emergency powers, such as President Washington's response to the Whiskey Rebellion and President Lincoln's actions during the Civil War. It notes the development of the practice of using proclamations to declare national emergencies, which activate standby statutory provisions. The report details the establishment of the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers, which identified 470 provisions of federal law delegating extraordinary authority to the executive in times of national emergency.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 was enacted to regulate the declaration and regulation of national emergencies, returning standby statutory delegations of emergency power to a dormant state two years after the statute's approval. The Act established a procedure for future declarations of national emergency by the President and prescribed arrangements for their congressional regulation.\n\nSince the enactment of the National Emergencies Act, various national emergencies have been declared, with some being revoked and others remaining in effect. The report suggests that further improvements and reforms in this policy area might be pursued and perfected. It also notes an anomaly in the activation of emergency powers during Hurricane Katrina, where President George W. Bush issued a proclamation suspending certain wage requirements without declaring a national emergency.\n\nIn summary, the report provides a comprehensive overview of the historical development and current state of emergency powers in the United States, emphasizing the importance of statutory law in regulating these powers and the potential for future reforms."]}

This program, operational since April 1971, aims to increase small businesses' access to government and private-sector contracting by guaranteeing bonds for contracts they cannot obtain through regular commercial channels. The program guarantees individual contracts up to $6.5 million, with a 80% to 90% guarantee rate if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion.\n\nSurety bonds are a three-party agreement between a surety, a contractor, and a project owner, reducing the risk of contracting and encouraging project owners to contract with small businesses. The SBA's program has faced legislative changes, including the introduction of the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the PSB program's guarantee rate from 70% to 90%.\n\nThe SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has been subject to congressional interest due to its role in enhancing economic growth through small business support. The program's size and effectiveness have been debated, with some arguing for its necessity to supplement the private market for surety bonds, while others believe the existing program is sufficient. The SBA has focused on attracting more sureties to the program and streamlining processes to encourage participation.\n\nThe report also discusses the historical development of the program, its current eligibility standards, and performance statistics. It highlights the importance of the program in assisting small businesses, particularly those owned by minorities and women, in accessing surety bonds and competing for contracts.

These reports must be publicly available and include information such as the lobbyist's name, client details, lobbying issues, and income or expenses related to lobbying activities. Lobbyists are also required to report certain political contributions semiannually. The LDA defines a lobbyist as someone who is employed or retained by a client for compensation, has made more than one lobbying contact, and whose lobbying activities represent at least 20 percent of their time spent on behalf of the client during the quarter.\n\nLobbying firms must register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for each client if they expect to receive more than $3,000 in income from that client for lobbying activities. They are also required to submit an LD-2 quarterly report for each registration filed.\n\nThe LDA requires lobbyists to disclose lobbying contacts made with federal agencies on behalf of the client for the reporting period. Lobbyists are also required to report previously held covered positions in the executive or legislative branch when first registering as a lobbyist for a new client.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) is responsible for enforcing LDA compliance. If lobbyists fail to comply with the LDA reporting, they may face civil or criminal penalties. The USAO has received numerous referrals for noncompliance and has taken enforcement actions to bring lobbying firms into compliance.\n\nThe report found that most lobbyists and lobbying firms found it \"very easy\" or \"somewhat easy\" to comply with reporting requirements. However, there were instances of noncompliance, such as failure to disclose income or expenses, failure to round income or expenses as required, and failure to properly disclose previously held covered positions.\n\nThe report also found that the USAO has sufficient personnel resources and authority to enforce reporting requirements. However, the number of assigned personnel has decreased due to attrition.

In fiscal year 2017, there were about 25,700 beneficiaries, with the average annual cost for medical treatment being approximately $6,980 per miner. The Trust Fund's revenue primarily comes from the coal tax, with rates varying based on mining methods. However, the Trust Fund has faced financial challenges, with expenditures consistently exceeding revenue. Despite legislative efforts to improve finances, the Trust Fund has accrued debt, with the principal amount of outstanding debt exceeding $10 billion by fiscal year 2008.\n\nThe Trust Fund's future financial position is uncertain due to a scheduled 55 percent decrease in the coal tax in 2019 and declining coal production. Simulations suggest that Trust Fund revenue may decrease from about $485 million in fiscal year 2018 to about $197 million in fiscal year 2050. This decrease in revenue may not be sufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments, administrative costs, and debt repayment expenditures.\n\nTo address these challenges, the report simulates various options, including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest on some or all Trust Fund debt, and forgiving some or all Trust Fund debt. The simulations show that increasing the coal tax rates by 25 percent could balance the Trust Fund by 2050 without requiring debt forgiveness. However, this option would place a significant burden on the coal industry. Maintaining current tax rates with about $2.4 billion of debt forgiveness could balance the Trust Fund by 2050, distributing the burden between the coal industry and general taxpayers.\n\nThe report also explores the impact of forgiving the Trust Fund's legacy debt or all Trust Fund debt on the average tax collected per ton needed to balance the Trust Fund by 2050. Forgiving the Trust Fund's legacy debt would allow for an average tax collected of about $0.59 per ton, while forgiving all Trust Fund debt would allow for an average tax collected per ton of $0.47.\n\nThe report concludes that multiple options could reduce the Trust Fund's future debt and distribute the financial burden among the coal industry and general taxpayers.

Counterfeiters now target primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores, aiming to deceive consumers into believing they are purchasing authentic goods. This shift has led to new deceptive tactics, such as exploiting third-party online marketplaces for legitimacy and setting prices close to genuine goods to trick consumers into paying higher prices.\n\nU.S. agencies and international organizations have observed an increase in the volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods, with China and Hong Kong being the primary sources. The variety of counterfeited products has also expanded beyond luxury items to nearly every industry.\n\nTo illustrate the risk of encountering counterfeit products online, a sample of consumer products was purchased from third-party sellers on popular e-commerce websites. The results showed that 20 out of 47 items were counterfeit, with no clear indicators of authenticity based on the product type, e-commerce website, or seller.\n\nCounterfeit goods pose health and safety risks, as evidenced by the failure rate of counterfeit iPhone adapters and the presence of hazardous substances in counterfeit cosmetics.\n\nE-commerce websites and rights holders have taken steps to protect intellectual property rights (IPR), including maintaining IPR protection teams and removing counterfeit items. However, the increasing sophistication of counterfeits and the growth of e-commerce present challenges for law enforcement and the private sector.\n\nCBP and ICE engage in various activities to enhance IPR enforcement, but CBP has limited evaluation of its efforts.

States must report expenditures quarterly within 30 days of the end of each quarter, with a 2-year filing limit for adjustments. CMS reviews these expenditures to ensure they are supported and allowable, with enhanced oversight in states with high federal Medicaid expenditures. The report highlights that CMS has identified errors and compliance issues through quarterly reviews and focused financial management reviews (FMRs), which are conducted annually on high-risk areas.\n\nHowever, the report also points out weaknesses in CMS's allocation of resources for overseeing state-reported expenditures. CMS has allocated similar staff resources to states with varying levels of risk, and has cancelled FMRs due to resource constraints. The report suggests that CMS should conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to ensure adequate and appropriate allocation of resources based on risk.\n\nThe report also identifies inconsistencies in variance analyses and sampling methodologies for higher matched expenditures, which may result in undetected errors and inappropriate federal funds allocation. The report recommends that CMS clarify internal guidance on variance analyses, revise the sampling methodology for Medicaid expansion enrollees, and complete a comprehensive risk assessment.\n\nThe report concludes that while CMS has processes in place to review state-reported expenditures, the increasing complexity of expenditure reporting and decreasing resources hinder CMS's ability to target risk effectively, potentially allowing for significant federal dollars in errors to go undetected."]}

Civil government agencies like NASA and NOAA have used or plan to use commercially hosted payloads.\n\nCommercially hosted payloads may be more affordable due to shared launch and ground systems costs, and they can achieve on-orbit capability more quickly. They also offer increased deterrence and resilience by distributing capabilities across more satellites, making it harder for adversaries to target specific assets.\n\nThe DOD's Hosted Payload Office (HPO) was established in 2011 to facilitate commercially hosted payload arrangements. The HPO provides acquisition architectures, conducts feasibility studies, publishes interface design guidelines, and develops a secure hosted payload data interface unit.\n\nDespite these benefits, the DOD's limited use of commercially hosted payloads is due to logistical challenges, such as matching size, weight, and power between government payloads and commercial host satellites. There are also concerns about payload control, cybersecurity, and the potential for commercial companies to prioritize their own needs over the government's.\n\nThe DOD's knowledge of commercially hosted payloads is fragmented across the agency, and there is a lack of centralized data collection and assessment. This fragmentation contributes to resistance within the DOD to using hosted payloads.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of Defense require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office.

GPRAMA also mandates the creation of a government-wide performance website, Performance.gov, to communicate performance information.\n\nThe report highlights that while some progress has been made in implementing GPRAMA, there are still opportunities for improvement. For example, the removal of the priority designation from CAP goals and APGs has stopped related data-driven reviews and quarterly updates on Performance.gov. The federal program inventory has also been postponed, with only one update since 2013.\n\nThe report recommends that the OMB should update Performance.gov to clarify the status of CAP goals and APGs, revise guidance for the federal program inventory, consider using an information architecture framework for the inventory, and work with the Performance Improvement Council to expand the use of data-driven performance reviews.\n\nThe report also notes that the use of performance information in decision-making has not significantly improved since 2013.

Fraud, which involves intentional deception to obtain something of value, is difficult to detect and measure, with no reliable estimates available. The report highlights the vulnerability of Medicare to fraud, waste, and abuse due to its size, scope, and complexity, and the high priority it has been designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) due to improper payments.\n\nThe report outlines the government's approach to managing fraud risks, including the Fraud Risk Framework and the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, which mandates the establishment of guidelines for federal agencies to create controls to identify and assess fraud risks. The report also discusses the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) within CMS, which leads antifraud efforts and has a direct reporting line to executive-level management.\n\nThe report identifies gaps in CMS's antifraud efforts, particularly the lack of a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare. It recommends that CMS conduct a fraud risk assessment for Medicare, develop a risk-based antifraud strategy, and establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to inform the strategy. The report also emphasizes the need for regular fraud risk assessments and the importance of involving stakeholders in the assessment process.\n\nIn conclusion, the report calls for CMS to take action to address fraud risks in Medicare by developing a comprehensive antifraud strategy, conducting regular fraud risk assessments, and ensuring that all employees are trained in fraud awareness.

{"samples": [" The government agency's report predicts that the state and local government sector will likely face a persistent gap between revenue and spending over the next 50 years, with expenditures growing at a faster rate than revenues. This gap, known as the fiscal gap, is estimated to be about 14.7 percent of total expenditures or about 2.4 percent of GDP. To close this gap, the report suggests that state and local governments will need to make policy changes, such as increasing revenues or reducing expenditures.\n\nThe report identifies health care expenditures as a significant driver of overall spending growth, with Medicaid spending and health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees expected to increase. It also highlights the need for state and local governments to manage their pension obligations, suggesting that pension contributions will need to be about 12.9 percent of wages and salaries to meet long-term pension obligations.\n\nThe report also discusses the impact of recent federal policy changes, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. Supreme Court decision, on the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. It suggests that these changes could affect the sector's revenues and expenditures, adding to the uncertainty of the long-term fiscal outlook.\n\nThe report concludes that maintaining the current policy and providing current per capita levels of public goods and services will result in a decline in the sector's operating balance. To maintain balance, the sector would need to spend about 14.7 percent less each year than it would under current policies.

The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) and Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) are integral systems to meet this legal requirement and execute the nation's military strategy. The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program was canceled due to excessive cost growth and poor performance, leading to the development of the ACV and MPC. The ACV is intended to replace the Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), while the MPC is designed to transport Marines ashore with enhanced amphibious capability.\n\nThe AAV has been in service since 1971 and is viewed as having capabilities shortfalls in areas such as water and land mobility performance, lethality, protection, and network capability. The MPC was viewed as necessary for the transport and enhanced armor protection of Marine infantry forces. However, budgetary pressures led to the MPC program being put on hold in 2013.\n\nIn response to evolving threats and the need to maintain amphibious assault capabilities, the Department of the Navy and DOD released a strategic vision for amphibious operations in 2012. The Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concept was developed to address the risks posed by advanced air and shore defense systems. EABO calls for a resilient forward basing infrastructure to support joint forces within range of adversary long-range precision fires.\n\nThe Marines' acquisition priorities shifted to the ACV and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), with the MPC being resurrected as ACV Increment 1.1 in 2014.

Coal mining, both surface and underground, can have significant environmental impacts, including water quality issues and land disturbance. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) regulates coal mining and requires operators to obtain permits, reclaim land post-mining, and provide financial assurances to ensure reclamation. SMCRA also established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to administer the act.\n\nAs of 2017, 23 states and four Indian tribes had \"primacy\" for their coal mining programs, meaning they had approval to administer SMCRA. Primacy states must demonstrate capability to regulate surface effects of coal mining and reclamation. Financial assurances for coal mine reclamation totaled approximately $10.2 billion in 2017, with surety bonds, collateral bonds, and self-bonds accounting for 76%, 12%, and 12% respectively.\n\nOSMRE conducts inspections and evaluations of state programs to ensure compliance with SMCRA. Challenges in managing financial assurances include the complexity of self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies. OSMRE has taken steps to review and adjust financial assurances, but the risk of self-bonding has increased due to recent bankruptcies in the coal industry.\n\nThe report suggests that Congress should consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation to mitigate financial risks for the government and taxpayers."]}

Since the federal fiscal year was shifted to October 1-September 30 in 1977, CRs have been enacted in four instances to fund certain unauthorized programs. The Antideficiency Act generally prohibits the obligation or expenditure of federal funds without appropriations, leading to funding gaps or lapses. These gaps can occur at the start of the fiscal year or when a CR expires without immediate enactment of another CR or regular appropriations bill.\n\nThe report details the guidance provided to federal agencies by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti's letters, which clarify the limits of federal government activities during funding gaps. The Civiletti letters state that agencies may not make contracts or obligate further funds during a funding gap, except as \"authorized by law,\" and generally do not permit the employment of federal employees during a lapse in appropriations.\n\nThe report also discusses the concept of an \"automatic continuing resolution\" (ACR) as a potential solution to avoid funding gaps. However, no ACR has been enacted into law on a permanent basis. The report lists 20 funding gaps since FY1977, with most occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. The duration of funding gaps has varied, with some lasting only a day or two, while others have lasted up to 34 days.\n\nThe report provides a detailed analysis of the legislative history of funding gaps, including the impact on federal employees and the measures taken to address these gaps.

Although it does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, the Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to include these forms of discrimination. Schools can be held liable for deliberately indifferent responses to sexual abuse or harassment. Title IX is enforced through private rights of action by students and by federal agencies like the Department of Education (ED). The ED has issued guidance documents to instruct schools on their responsibilities under Title IX, and schools have developed procedures to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has established a high standard for liability under Title IX, requiring schools to respond to known discrimination with deliberate indifference. This standard is based on the school's response to its actual knowledge of the discrimination, not the misconduct itself. The court has also set forth specific elements that must be proven in a Title IX claim, including actual notice of discrimination, by an appropriate person, and deliberate indifference by the school.\n\nTitle IX is enforced by federal agencies, with the ED playing a lead role. The ED has issued regulations that apply to educational institutions of all levels receiving federal assistance. These regulations require schools to designate a Title IX Coordinator and establish grievance procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment.\n\nThe ED's enforcement of Title IX has been challenged in court by students who argue that universities' responses to allegations of sexual harassment violate their due process rights. Courts have generally upheld the constitutionality of Title IX procedures, but have also recognized the need for due process protections in disciplinary proceedings.\n\nIn 2017, the ED withdrew some of its prior guidance on Title IX enforcement and began the process to codify a school's responsibilities under Title IX.

{"samples": [" The U.S. corporate income tax system is based on worldwide economic activity, which complicates tax administration and compliance for corporations operating in multiple jurisdictions. Strategies like expatriation, inversions, and mergers are used by corporations to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act) made it more difficult for corporations to invert by denying or restricting tax benefits if the new company's owners were not substantially different from the original company and required substantial business operations in the new country.\n\nDespite these measures, inversions continued, with companies like Pfizer and Omnicom showing interest in merging with non-U.S. firms. The Treasury Department responded with regulatory changes in 2014 to restrict some aspects of inversions. However, new inversions slowed but not entirely stopped, with some firms structuring their mergers to avoid regulations by reducing ownership below 60%.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 made major changes to the corporate tax and international tax rules, including a new system for taxing foreign source income of U.S. subsidiaries and a Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (BEAT) to address profit shifting. The TCJA also lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which could reduce the incentive for inversions.\n\nThe report concludes that while administrative remedies have been successful in slowing inversions, further legislative changes could be made to discourage inversions. These could include extending the rate recapture enacted in the 2017 Act, restricting the ability of U.S. firms to invert by merger, or treating all mergers as U.S. firms when the U.S. firm's shareholders hold more than 50% or when management and control primarily takes place in the United States."]}

Georgia's government is a parliamentary system with a prime minister as the most powerful executive. The country has experienced democratic reforms and is considered one of the most democratic states among the USSR's successor states.\n\nGeorgia's economy has been recovering from the economic decline after the Soviet Union's collapse, with a GDP of around $16.7 billion in 2018. The country has seen strong economic growth, with the IMF forecasting a sustained rate of GDP growth of around 4.9% annually from 2019 to 2021. Georgia's economy is largely dependent on remittances from labor migration, with Russia being the source of almost 60% of Georgian remittances. The country has also been improving its energy security and has signed free trade agreements with the EU and China.\n\nGeorgia has been seeking closer integration with the EU and NATO, with over 80% of the Georgian population supporting EU membership and over 75% supporting NATO membership. However, Georgia's path to membership in these organizations remains unclear due to concerns about its territorial conflicts with Russia and the lack of support for enlargement among many EU members.\n\nThe United States is one of Georgia's closest partners, with a history of strong economic aid and security cooperation. The U.S. supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has provided significant military and foreign aid to the country. The U.S. and Georgia have held annual joint military exercises since 2011, and the U.S. has approved the provision of major defensive lethal weaponry to Georgia.\n\nIn summary, Georgia is a country with a rich history, a complex political landscape, and a developing economy.

{"samples": [" Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are complex, lifelong conditions that can lead to various secondary complications, including autonomic dysreflexia, depression, impaired bowel and bladder function, pressure ulcers, spasticity, and syringomyelia. These complications can significantly impact functional independence and quality of life. Medicare payments for long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are typically higher than those for acute care hospitals to reflect the resources required for long-term care. The Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 introduced a two-tiered payment system for LTCHs, with certain discharges receiving the standard rate and others a lower, site-neutral rate.\n\nTwo LTCHs, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center, have qualified for a temporary exception to the site-neutral payment policy. Both hospitals specialize in treating patients with spinal cord and brain injuries and offer specialized programs and services. They treat a high volume of patients with complex conditions and have specialized staff with training in medical rehabilitation. They also admit a significant number of patients from out-of-state and provide a continuum of care without the need for patients to transfer to different facilities.\n\nSimulations of Medicare payments indicate that the site-neutral payment policies could significantly affect the payments to these qualifying hospitals. If fewer than half of an LTCH's discharges meet the statutory requirements to be paid at the standard rate, the LTCH will no longer receive any payments at that rate for discharges in future cost reporting periods until eligibility for receiving payments under that rate is reinstated.\n\nThe report also highlights the differences between LTCHs and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) in terms of patient assessment tools, payment systems, and the ability to treat medically complex patients. The two qualifying hospitals have developed expertise in treating patients with catastrophic spinal cord, acquired brain injuries, or other paralyzing neuromuscular conditions and offer intensive rehabilitation services that are not provided in most other LTCHs.\n\nThe report concludes that the two qualifying hospitals, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center, provide specialized care for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, offering a more complete continuum of care without the need to transfer patients to different facilities.

{"samples": [" The Congressional Gold Medal is a prestigious award given by the U.S. Congress to recognize distinguished contributions and commemorate significant events. First issued by the Continental Congress in the late 1700s, the tradition of awarding gold medals has continued to the present day, with no permanent statutory provisions for their creation. Congress has historically authorized gold medals for military achievements, but since 1854, the scope has expanded to include nonmilitary heroic activities and contributions in various fields such as arts, science, and diplomacy.\n\nThe process for creating a Congressional Gold Medal involves legislative action, with bills typically referred to the House Committee on Financial Services or the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. There are no formal rules regarding the number of cosponsors required for committee consideration, but informal practices may exist. Once a bill is introduced, it may be brought to the floor without committee consideration or may be discharged by unanimous consent after a sufficient number of cosponsors sign on.\n\nThe design of the gold medal is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, who consults with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. The legislation typically includes a section detailing the presentation, design, and striking of the medal, as well as provisions for minting and selling duplicates.\n\nCongressional Gold Medal legislation has no statutory limit on the number of medals that can be struck in a year, and there is no formal requirement for a minimum number of cosponsors for committee consideration. However, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs requires at least 67 Senators to cosponsor a Congressional Gold Medal bill before it is considered by the committee.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of the Congressional Gold Medal as a means for Congress to express public gratitude for significant achievements and events. The number of gold medals awarded has increased in recent years, with 52 bills introduced in the 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses to award a gold medal.\n\nAs Congress continues to consider legislation for future gold medals, considerations such as who should be honored, the number of medals to be awarded, and whether specific design elements should be prescribed will likely remain important factors."]}

Cobra Dane, operated by the Air Force and MDA, contributes to ballistic missile defense by tracking and classifying missile threats, and can potentially discriminate between warheads and decoys. However, it currently lacks the capability to determine if a missile threat was successfully intercepted, a feature that could be added in the future.\n\nThe report also highlights the operational advantages and cost savings of locating the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear Air Force Station, which will complement Cobra Dane's capabilities. The Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of Cobra Dane, as well as for three modernization projects to sustain the radar.\n\nThe report notes that the operational availability of Cobra Dane has declined slightly, but it remains above the required 90% availability. The Air Force and MDA have plans to mitigate the impact of Cobra Dane's unavailability by deploying the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide additional tracking coverage.\n\nThe report also outlines the funding plans for the operation and maintenance of Cobra Dane, with the Air Force and MDA contributing a total of $278.6 million based on their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. The Air Force is solely responsible for funding all work related to the operation and sustainment of Shemya Island, where Cobra Dane is located.\n\nIn conclusion, the report emphasizes the importance of Cobra Dane and other radar systems in supporting various defense missions and the ongoing efforts to maintain and modernize these systems to ensure their continued effectiveness."]}

The Controlled Substances Act requires entities involved in these processes to register with DEA. The Disposal Act, amended in 2010, allows the public to dispose of unused controlled substances at authorized entities. DEA regulations detail disposal methods, including bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Law enforcement can use these methods without DEA authorization. Eligible entities, such as pharmacies and hospitals, must modify their DEA registration to become authorized collectors. DEA regulations stipulate secure disposal bin requirements, including location, signage, and maintenance. Authorized collectors must destroy collected substances in compliance with federal, state, and local laws.\n\nAs of April 2017, about 2.49% of eligible entities were authorized collectors, with most being pharmacies. Participation varied by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate at 32%. Most authorized collectors were in urban areas, but a higher percentage of eligible entities in rural areas became authorized collectors. DEA does not collect information on the use of disposal bins, and the extent of their use is unknown. However, it is estimated that about half of the population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin.\n\nFactors affecting participation include costs, uncertainty over regulations, and participation in other disposal efforts. Costs include purchasing and installing bins, training staff, and contracting with reverse distributors. Uncertainty arises from compliance with DEA regulations, particularly regarding the non-retrievable standard for destruction of inner liners. Some stakeholders also participate in other disposal efforts, reducing the need for additional resources.\n\nDEA has made efforts to improve communication with stakeholders, including subscriptions to their website for updates. The report concludes that while DEA has provided guidance, stakeholders still face challenges in becoming authorized collectors, and the availability of other disposal options contributes to low participation rates."]}
{"samples": [" The House of Representatives has standing rules that govern the consideration of bills and resolutions on the floor. To expedite legislation, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for non-privileged measures through a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure. The suspension procedure is typically used for broadly supported legislation that can be approved without extensive debate or amendments. It allows non-privileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments.\n\nThe suspension procedure is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV and can be applied to various types of business. A motion to suspend the rules is a compound motion to suspend the House rules and pass a bill or agree to a resolution. The House rules that are suspended under this procedure include those that would impede an immediate vote on passage of a measure.\n\nDebate time is controlled by two floor managers, one from each party, who sit on a committee of jurisdiction. Once debate has concluded, a single vote is held on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure. The motion requires approval by two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present.\n\nIn the 114th Congress, the majority of measures considered on the House floor were called up under the suspension of the rules procedure. Most suspension measures were bills, and most were sponsored by members of the majority party. Most suspension measures were referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the chamber floor.\n\nThe suspension procedure is a common way to consider minority-sponsored legislation in the House. In the 114th Congress, 85% of the minority-sponsored measures that were considered on the House floor were raised under the suspension procedure.\n\nThe suspension procedure is a key tool for the House to expedite legislation and is used to consider a wide range of policy areas, most often addressing government operations.

NCA oversees national cemeteries and provides funding through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program to assist state and tribal governments in establishing, expanding, or improving veterans' cemeteries. NCA has revised its policies to better serve veterans, including lowering the threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from 170,000 to 80,000 unserved veterans. NCA aims to provide reasonable access to burial options for veterans, with a current goal of 95% coverage by 2022.\n\nNCA's plan includes establishing 18 new national cemeteries and awarding funds for state veterans' cemeteries. However, progress has been limited due to challenges in acquiring suitable land, estimating costs, and targeting unserved veteran populations. NCA has opened four new traditional national cemeteries and two rural initiative cemeteries, increasing the percentage of veterans with reasonable access to burial options from 90% to about 92%.\n\nThe report highlights three key challenges NCA faces: acquiring land, estimating costs, and using data to target unserved veteran populations. The report also notes that NCA's cost estimates for rural initiative sites have significantly increased, raising concerns about the reliability of cost estimates. The report recommends that NCA revise its cost-estimating guidance to fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, which would help provide more reliable cost estimates and inform decisions regarding the funding and oversight of cemetery construction projects."]}

Since 2009, the number of crashes and fatalities has plateaued, with around 2,100 crashes and 250 fatalities annually. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) share responsibilities for grade-crossing safety, with the FHWA overseeing the Section 130 Program, which provides funds for safety improvements at grade crossings. The program requires states to establish schedules for safety improvement projects, including the installation of protective devices.\n\nThe FRA is responsible for safety oversight of railroads, collecting and analyzing data, and issuing regulations. The FRA has created a new discipline for grade-crossing safety and is hiring new inspectors to conduct field investigations and recommend safety improvements. The FRA also maintains the National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory and the Railroad Accident/Incident Reporting System.\n\nThe FRA has conducted research to understand the causes of grade-crossing crashes and to identify potential improvements. The FRA's research has found that the volumes of train and vehicle traffic are the biggest predictors of grade-crossing crashes. The FRA is also exploring new technologies to improve safety, such as automated and connected vehicle technologies.\n\nThe FHWA and FRA provide guidance and resources to states for selecting and implementing grade-crossing projects. States use a variety of factors to select projects, including accident prediction models and the proximity of projects along railroad corridors. The FHWA requires states to develop a grade-crossing program that considers relative risk.\n\nThe FHWA and FRA have faced challenges in measuring the effectiveness of grade-crossing safety projects due to the low number of crashes and the difficulty in distinguishing between different projects in terms of their effectiveness. The FHWA has not conducted a program evaluation of the Section 130 Program to assess its effectiveness in reducing fatalities and injuries.\n\nThe report recommends that the FHWA should evaluate the Section 130 Program's requirements to determine whether they allow states sufficient flexibility to address current and emerging safety issues.

Initially created by George Washington in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit, it was revived in 1932 by General Douglas MacArthur and renamed the Purple Heart. The award was initially given for meritorious acts but later focused on soldiers killed or wounded in combat. Over the years, eligibility has expanded to include servicemembers wounded or killed in various circumstances, including terrorist attacks and peacekeeping operations.\n\nCongress has played a significant role in adjusting Purple Heart eligibility, with notable changes in the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 1996, 1998, and 2015. The 2015 NDAA expanded eligibility by redefining what constitutes an attack by a foreign terrorist organization, allowing servicemembers wounded or killed in the 2009 shootings at Ft. Hood and Little Rock to receive the Purple Heart.\n\nThe Purple Heart is awarded to servicemembers who have been wounded or died from wounds sustained under specific conditions, including actions against an opposing armed force, while serving with friendly foreign forces, or as a result of an act of an enemy or opposing armed forces. The award can also be given for wounds requiring treatment by a military medical officer.\n\nRecent debates have centered on expanding eligibility to include conditions such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as terrorist attacks. The Department of Defense (DOD) currently does not consider servicemembers with PTSD eligible for the Purple Heart, but there is ongoing debate and advocacy for its inclusion.\n\nThe Purple Heart is a contentious issue, with veterans groups often voicing their views on proposed changes to eligibility. The award's history and current eligibility criteria are subject to change, reflecting the evolving nature of military service and the recognition of servicemembers' sacrifices."]}

ABAWDs, aged 18-49 without dependents, face additional work requirements, including 20 hours of work or participation in workfare programs. States can waive these time limits under certain conditions, such as high unemployment rates.\n\nSNAP E&T programs offer employment and training services to SNAP recipients, with states choosing between mandatory or voluntary participation. Federal funding is available for these programs, and states have the flexibility to design their programs. However, SNAP has faced issues with improper payments, with $2.6 billion in errors in fiscal year 2014. States and FNS work together to prevent and address fraud, including eligibility fraud and trafficking.\n\nThe report highlights a decrease in SNAP E&T participation from fiscal year 2008 to 2016, with states increasingly moving to voluntary programs. States have also focused more on serving ABAWDs as waivers have expired. Partnerships with other organizations have been encouraged to enhance SNAP E&T programs.\n\nFNS has taken steps to increase federal support for SNAP E&T programs, including creating the Office of Employment and Training and providing additional technical assistance. However, challenges remain, including data quality issues and the need for improved guidance on fraud prevention and detection.\n\nThe report also addresses retailer trafficking, which continues to be a problem. FNS has increased food stock requirements and focused on high-risk retailers, but penalties for trafficking may still be insufficient.

The first LNG-powered vessel began service in 2000, and the use of LNG as a primary fuel is a relatively new endeavor. The report highlights the need for specialized infrastructure and regulatory oversight for LNG bunkering, as well as the safety implications of LNG use in shipping.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set standards limiting sulfur content in shipping fuels, which has led vessel operators to consider alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. The IMO's Annex VI requires vessel operators to use fuels with less than 0.5% sulfur content or install exhaust gas-cleaning systems. The United States has effectively ratified MARPOL Annex VI, with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency jointly enforcing the emissions standards.\n\nShip owners have two main options for meeting the emission requirements: switching to low-sulfur fuel or installing scrubbers. The simplest option is switching to low-sulfur fuel, which would increase fuel costs but allow the use of existing infrastructure. Scrubbers, while allowing the use of high-sulfur fuel, require a significant initial investment and may need further refitting to comply with future IMO standards.\n\nThe report also discusses the potential economic opportunities for the United States, including the creation of a new market for domestic natural gas and economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding. However, it also notes that rising demand for LNG could increase natural gas prices for domestic consumers and that the overall environmental impact depends on practices in the natural gas industry.\n\nThe report concludes by suggesting that Congress could encourage the growth of LNG bunkering through various means, such as providing tax incentives, addressing regulatory barriers, and providing funding for technical support. However, it also notes that the future of LNG as a ship fuel is uncertain, and the potential benefits or costs of LNG bunkering are hard to predict."]}

The report also highlights the regional and school type disparities in discipline, with corporal punishment more prevalent in southern states and alternative schools having higher suspension rates.\n\nSchool officials from five selected districts discussed challenges in addressing student behavior, including the effects of poverty, mental health issues, and family dysfunction. The report suggests that schools are moving away from exclusionary discipline to alternative models that focus on positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS), restorative justice practices, and social emotional learning (SEL).\n\nThe report concludes that while there are efforts to address discipline disparities, implementation challenges persist due to limited resources, staffing turnover, and resistance to alternative discipline methods. The report recommends continued efforts to identify and address discipline disparities and discrimination, including the use of data to identify disparities and the implementation of alternative discipline models."]}

This land is primarily concentrated in 12 western states, with the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Forest Service (FS) administering about 95% of these lands. The authorities for acquiring and disposing of these lands vary among the agencies, with the BLM having the broadest authority. The NPS has limited authority to acquire land for new park units or dispose of park lands, while the FS and FWS have more moderate authorities.\n\nAcquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that could benefit from federal management, such as improving management of federal lands, conserving species, protecting natural and cultural resources, and increasing recreational opportunities. Disposal authorities are intended to allow federal agencies to dispose of land that is no longer required for federal purposes, is inefficient to manage, or is chiefly valuable for another purpose.\n\nExchanges are also a common method of land management, with the BLM and FS having broader exchange authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). Congress often considers legislation to establish, modify, or eliminate acquisition and disposal authorities, with proposals ranging from authorizing states to exchange land grant parcels for federal lands to amending existing authorities.\n\nThe primary financing mechanism for federal land acquisition is discretionary appropriations under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The LWCF Act of 1965 provided for $900 million in specified revenues to be deposited in the LWCF annually, but these provisions expired in 2018. Congress determines the level of appropriations from the LWCF for federal land acquisition each year.\n\nThe four federal land management agencies have different standing authorities for acquiring lands, with the NPS having the narrowest authorities and the BLM having the broadest.

The FLSA, enacted in 1938, allows the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit these exemptions. To qualify for the EAP exemption, an employee must meet three criteria: the \"salary basis\" test, the \"duties\" test, and the \"salary level\" test. The salary basis requires a fixed salary, the duties test specifies the nature of the work performed, and the salary level test sets a minimum salary threshold.\n\nThe FLSA applies to both private and public sector employees, including institutions of higher education (IHEs) and state and local governments. However, certain employees, such as fire protection and law enforcement workers in small agencies, and certain state and local employees, are exempt from overtime pay requirements.\n\nThe FLSA also applies to employees in U.S. territories, with specific salary level thresholds set for each territory. The FLSA overtime provisions are enforced by the Department of Labor (DOL), which has issued regulations and updated the salary level thresholds for the EAP exemptions over time.\n\nIn 2019, the DOL proposed a rule to update the EAP exemptions, which included an increase in the salary level test from $455 per week to $679 per week. The proposed rule aimed to expand overtime coverage to EAP employees through a higher salary level threshold rather than through additional classes of employees. The DOL estimated that approximately 4.9 million workers would be affected by the proposed rule.\n\nThe 2016 final rule, which was invalidated before taking effect, had set the salary level threshold at $913 per week.

The U.S. has seen an increase in domestic crude oil production and a decrease in net imports, with projections indicating that the U.S. will become a net exporter by the late 2020s. This shift in market dynamics means that the U.S. would no longer have a 90-day reserve obligation under the International Energy Agency (IEA), as the obligation is based on net imports.\n\nThe SPR, owned by the federal government and managed by the Department of Energy (DOE), is currently maintained by Fluor Federal Petroleum Operations LLC and stores crude oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast. The SPR's infrastructure has aged, leading to maintenance challenges and reliability concerns. The report highlights the importance of well-functioning infrastructure for the SPR's operational readiness.\n\nThe SPR has been used to meet the U.S.'s IEA obligations, including collective actions in response to supply disruptions. The report notes that the U.S. has participated in all three IEA collective actions, with the most recent being in response to supply disruptions in Libya.\n\nThe report also discusses the differences between the U.S. and other IEA members in how they meet their reserve obligations, with most relying on private reserves and holding significant proportions of these reserves as petroleum products. The U.S. holds predominantly crude oil in the SPR, with the exception of the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve.\n\nThe report criticizes the DOE for not fully considering the implications of market fluctuations, private-sector response, and the costs of different SPR sizes in its strategic review. It recommends that the DOE conduct additional analyses to inform Congress on the optimal size of the SPR and the need for regional product reserves. The report also suggests that the DOE should consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess SPR assets.\n\nIn summary, the report emphasizes the need for the DOE to periodically reassess the SPR's size and configuration to ensure it remains effective in meeting U.S. energy security needs and IEA obligations."]}

The MSPV-NG program aims to achieve greater clinical consistency, cost avoidance, and efficiency in ordering and supply chain management. However, the transition has faced challenges due to a lack of a documented program strategy, leadership instability, and workforce capacity.\n\nThe initial requirements development process was criticized for relying heavily on previous supply purchases rather than clinician input, leading to a formulary that did not meet the needs of medical centers. The VA has since made changes to increase clinical involvement and is working on a strategy to prioritize supply categories for future phases of requirement development and contracting.\n\nThe VA has also faced difficulties in tracking cost avoidance related to MSPV-NG and in replacing non-competitive Phase 1 agreements with competitive awards. The Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) is hiring more staff to manage the increased workload and is developing a plan to mitigate potential gaps in contract coverage.\n\nThe VA plans to replace the current MSPV-NG contract and formulary process with a new approach where the prime vendor would develop the formulary.

While the U.S. Code does not explicitly assign this task to the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary is believed to retain implicit authority due to the location of the relevant section in the code. The Naval History and Heritage Command compiles primary and alternate ship name recommendations, which are forwarded to the Chief of Naval Operations. The Secretary of the Navy then selects names for specific ships, considering various factors such as historical precedent, geographic distribution, and the honor of individuals.\n\nThe Navy's ship-naming policies and practices are not fixed but evolve over time, reflecting technological changes and the Secretary's interpretation of the original naming convention. Exceptions to the naming rules have occurred, particularly for ships named for Presidents or Members of Congress, which are now considered a \"special cross-type naming convention.\"\n\nThe Navy has named ships for various reasons, including states, battles, and individuals, with the naming rules for different ship types changing over time. For example, attack submarines were once named for fish, then cities, and most recently for states, while cruisers were named for cities, then states, and most recently for battles.\n\nThe Navy has also named ships for living persons, a practice that has become more common since the 1970s. The July 2012 Navy report to Congress discusses the evolution of ship-naming policies and practices, noting that exceptions to the rules have been made to honor individuals, particularly Presidents and Members of Congress.\n\nThe report also addresses the public's interest in having Navy ships named for their states, cities, or individuals they admire. While the Navy considers public input, the final decision on ship names rests with the Secretary of the Navy.

{"samples": [" The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018) highlighted the impacts of global climate change in the United States, emphasizing that future impacts will depend on actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to changes. While efforts to reduce GHG emissions are ongoing, there is a range of views among federal policymakers and stakeholders on climate change and its mitigation. Some argue for significant GHG emission reductions to avoid dire effects, citing authoritative reports like the IPCC's Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (2018) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program's Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018).\n\nA carbon tax or GHG emissions fee is one policy option to control GHG emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion. This approach could increase the relative price of carbon-intensive energy sources, stimulating innovation and efficiency improvements. However, it could also have economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and demographic groups.\n\nThe report examines the design issues of a carbon tax, including the point of taxation, rate of taxation, and potential border carbon adjustments. It also discusses the distribution of carbon tax revenues and additional considerations associated with a carbon tax program.\n\nThe report suggests that if Congress were to establish a carbon tax system, it would face key design decisions, such as the point of taxation, rate of taxation, and addressing imported carbon-intensive materials. The point of taxation would determine which entities would be required to make tax payments, monitor emissions, and maintain records.\n\nThe report also discusses the potential economic impacts of a carbon tax, including the potential for GHG emission reductions, the generation of new revenue, and the distribution of these revenues. It highlights the trade-offs policymakers would face when deciding how to allocate carbon tax revenues, such as minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups, and supporting specific policy objectives.\n\nThe report concludes that while a carbon tax could achieve emission reductions, it would also generate new revenue and have potential economic impacts. Policymakers would need to carefully consider the distribution of these revenues and the potential impacts on various sectors and population groups."]}

The funding for these benefits is divided among the USPS, the federal government, and retirees. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 required USPS to start fully prefunding retiree health benefits, creating the Retiree Health Benefits (RHB) Fund. However, USPS has missed payments to the fund, and it is projected to be depleted by 2030. This could lead to USPS resuming \"pay-as-you-go\" payments for retiree health premiums, potentially affecting postal retirees and the federal government.\n\nThe report suggests that the RHB Fund is on an unsustainable path and that USPS may not be able to cover its share of retiree health insurance premiums if its financial condition remains precarious. The report also notes that most companies do not offer retiree health benefits, and those that do often make changes to control costs.\n\nTo address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits, the report identifies eight potential policy approaches, which fall into three categories: shifting costs to the federal government, reducing benefits or increasing costs to postal retirees and/or postal employees, and changing how the benefits are financed. These approaches could have different effects and would require congressional action.\n\nThe report concludes that Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. It emphasizes the importance of addressing the poor financial outlook of the RHB Fund to prevent serious consequences for postal retirees, USPS, postal customers, and other stakeholders."]}

Prenatal opioid use can take various forms, including prescription pain management, medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, prescription drug misuse, and illicit opioid use. Medication-assisted treatment is generally considered the standard of care for treating pregnant women with opioid use disorders. However, there is no national standard of care for screening or treating NAS, and gaps in research and data on NAS make it challenging to fully understand the problem.\n\nHealthcare providers predominantly diagnose NAS using the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool, which calculates a score based on various symptoms. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend non-pharmacologic treatment as the initial approach, which includes placing the infant in a dark and quiet environment, swaddling, breastfeeding, rooming-in with the mother, and providing high-calorie nutrition. Pharmacologic treatment may be necessary for moderate to severe signs of NAS.\n\nMedicaid, a federal-state health care program, finances health care coverage for low-income and medically needy populations, including children and aged or disabled adults. More than 80 percent of NAS cases are paid for by Medicaid. The Medicaid program allows states to design and implement their programs within certain federal parameters, resulting in more than 50 distinct state-based programs.\n\nMost infants with NAS are treated in a hospital setting, often in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which has a relatively high daily cost of care. Healthcare providers in the four selected states generally start with non-pharmacologic treatment and may continue to monitor and assess the severity of the infant\u2019s NAS symptoms using available scoring tools.

The PSOB program offers cash benefits, while the PSOEA program provides educational assistance to the families of officers killed or permanently disabled.\n\nEligibility for PSOB benefits includes law enforcement officers, firefighters, chaplains, FEMA employees, and emergency medical services members. There is no minimum service requirement, and benefits are paid if the injury or death is the direct result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. The PSOB program covers injuries incurred during authorized activities, emergency responses, or commuting to and from duty.\n\nThe PSOB program's lump-sum death benefit for FY2019 was $359,316, and the monthly full-time attendance PSOEA assistance was $1,224. Benefits are adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living. Death benefits are paid to eligible survivors, and disability benefits are paid only for permanent and total disabilities.\n\nThe PSOEA program offers financial assistance for higher education expenses to the spouse or children of eligible officers. The spouse must have been married to the officer at the time of death or injury, and the child must be enrolled in an eligible educational institution. The maximum duration of PSOEA benefits is 45 months of full-time education or a proportionate duration of part-time education.\n\nThe PSOB program is administered by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance, and funding is provided through the annual Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The PSOB program's death benefits are mandatory spending, while disability and PSOEA benefits are discretionary.\n\nThe PSOB program also covers certain cardiovascular conditions under specific circumstances, and the PSOEA program has provisions for extending the age limit in extraordinary circumstances.

It relies on information technology (IT) to support its mission, with a total appropriation of approximately $12 billion in fiscal year 2017, including $424 million for IT and $31 million for IT security. The CDC's IT infrastructure includes network components, critical servers, and data centers, and is managed by a chief information officer (CIO) and a chief information security officer (CISO). The agency is subject to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, which requires a comprehensive information security program.\n\nThe CDC's IT systems support public health science, practice, and administration, and are subject to various security controls and assessments. However, a report from June 2018 found deficiencies in the CDC's technical controls and information security program, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive health-related information. The report identified deficiencies in all five core security functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.\n\nThe CDC had not always effectively implemented controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems and information. Deficiencies included outdated categorization of systems, inadequate risk assessments, insufficient documentation of technical requirements, and lack of timely remediation of identified deficiencies. The report also highlighted the need for more secure password settings, appropriate access controls, and effective incident response capabilities.\n\nSince the report, the CDC has made significant progress in implementing recommendations to resolve technical security control deficiencies and improve its information security program. As of August 3, 2018, the CDC had fully implemented 55 percent of the 184 recommendations and partially implemented 11 percent. However, the agency had not provided evidence for implementing the remaining 34 percent of the recommendations. The CDC is working to address these deficiencies and ensure the protection of its information systems and networks."]}

Lawrence is bitten by a werewolf and becomes a werewolf himself, leading to a series of violent encounters. The film was criticized for its lack of emotional connection and for wasting the talents of its supporting cast.

{"samples": [" The Washington region, which houses the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, could face a significant economic impact if the federal government shuts down. An estimated $200 million a day could be lost, and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. This doesn't include the potential blow to tourism, a major economic pillar, if federally funded attractions like the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo, and Civil War battlefields are closed. The national economy may not notice a shutdown unless it lasts three or four weeks, but for the Washington area, it could be a \"tsunami\". The region's economy is already weak, with sequestration cuts costing the region 26,500 net jobs in August. A shutdown could exacerbate this situation, with 60% of the area's 377,000 federal workers deemed \"nonessential\" and sent home. This could lead to less money spent at local businesses or vendors. The shutdown could also affect every federal agency in some way, with potential delays in services and backlogs in processing federal benefits. The ripple effects could be devastating, impacting state and local governments' ability to continue critical services. Local governments have been setting aside money in anticipation of a shutdown to mitigate these effects."]}

The company disclosed the theft of customer information late last week, stating that it first learned of suspicious activity involving credit cards used at its stores in mid-December. Neiman Marcus has not publicly given any estimate of how many credit card numbers were stolen or how many customers were affected. The company has faced criticism for not disclosing the breach sooner, with some suggesting that the delay was timed to avoid affecting holiday sales.\n\nA 17-page report from computer firm iSight, hired to investigate the Target data breach, provides insight into the hacking that endangered data for over 100 million customers. The report details the type of software used in the hack, how it was effective, and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off such a digital heist. The report does not draw conclusions on who is ultimately responsible for the attack.\n\nThe data breach at Target was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems. The report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach.\n\nThe holiday data breach at Target Corp. appeared to be part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts."]}

This incident occurred on March 30, 2016, and sparked a debate about the balance between protecting people and conserving lions. The lion's death was described as brutal and senseless by many, with social media users expressing outrage and disappointment. The lion had been involved in territorial fights and was trying to establish new territory when it attacked the man.\n\nIn South Africa, a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and was initially threatened with death by wildlife officials. However, after public outcry, officials reconsidered and decided to capture and relocate the lion instead. The lion had previously escaped from the park and was labeled \"Spook\" due to its ability to evade capture.\n\nThe incidents highlight the challenges faced by wildlife officials in managing lions that stray from their natural habitats. The decisions to kill or tranquilize the lions depend on various factors, including the training of wildlife experts, resources available, and the population density of the area where the lion is roaming. In some cases, local residents have killed lions before officials could arrive.\n\nThe incidents also underscore the need for better conservation efforts and habitat preservation to protect these endangered species. The decline in lion populations due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders has intensified concerns about the species' survival."]}

{"samples": [" Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have announced new evidence of a ninth planet, referred to as \"Planet Nine,\" in our solar system. The planet is believed to be five to ten times the mass of Earth and is located far beyond the orbit of Pluto. The existence of Planet Nine has been inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of this hidden planet. The planet is estimated to be about two to four times the diameter of Earth, making it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. However, due to its extreme distance from the sun, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) had previously demoted Pluto to a \"dwarf planet\" status, a decision that was largely influenced by the discovery of many small worlds in the outer solar system, some close to the size of Pluto. The IAU's decision was based on the definition of a planet as an object that \"clears the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone, meaning it has the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine is still a big unknown, and further observations and detections of perturbed bodies would bolster the hypothesis. However, the odds of its discovery are considered high, with one astronomer putting the odds at \"maybe 90 percent.\" The discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant cultural moment, marking the third planetary discovery in modern history."]}

{"samples": [" The news discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, a hypothetical structure that could be used by advanced alien civilizations to harness the energy of their star. The idea was first proposed by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and later by physicist Freeman Dyson in a 1960 scientific paper. Dyson suggested that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. He proposed that these civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy.\n\nAstrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed in 1962 that very old and advanced civilizations would be of three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Type I civilizations harness all the resources of a planet, Type II civilizations harness all the radiation of a star, and Type III civilizations harness all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nThe news also mentions the concept of \"statites,\" which are satellites that would hover in space, collecting energy from the star and beaming it back to the home planet. These structures are often featured in science fiction, such as Larry Niven's 1970 novel \"Ringworld\" and the 1992 \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the news discusses the potential existence of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures as a means for advanced alien civilizations to harness the energy of their star, and how these structures could be recognized by their waste heat and unusual light signatures."]}

Stephen Colbert, who had previously worked with Stewart on The Dana Carvey Show, joined the show as a correspondent.\n\nThe show's field pieces, which often featured correspondents interacting with politicians and media figures, became a key part of its satirical approach. A turning point came in 1999 when Steve Carell, playing a correspondent, asked Senator John McCain a question that led to an uncomfortable moment. This incident highlighted the show's ability to add a level of insight to the political process.\n\nThe Daily Show's success was due to its ability to deconstruct the political process and provide a satirical take on the news.

{"samples": [" Scientists have discovered that Mars once had a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere, making it a more promising place for life. This ocean, which was a mile deep in places, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. The evidence for this ancient ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was unveiled by NASA and adds to the emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth. The scientists used powerful infrared telescopes to study Mars' atmosphere and found that the concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian water is much higher than on Earth. This suggests that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the amount now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The ocean likely covered nearly a fifth of Mars' surface, similar to the Atlantic Ocean covering about 17% of Earth's surface.

{"samples": [" The T. rex's roar, a staple in popular culture, is likely not accurate. New research suggests that dinosaurs, including the T. rex, may have made sounds similar to today's birds, such as the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. These sounds are referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low, throaty whooshes of air produced by an esophageal pouch. This research, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of various bird and crocodilian species, finding that about a quarter of the 200 bird species studied emitted these closed-mouth sounds. The study suggests that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities.\n\nThe sounds in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" were created by sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who used a variety of animal sounds to create the dinosaur noises. For example, the T. rex's roar was created using a baby elephant's cry, while the velociraptors' hiss was inspired by a goose. The study also suggests that dinosaurs likely did not have vocal cords but instead had air sacs and possibly a birdlike syrinx.\n\nThe research indicates that closed-mouth vocalizations have evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves, predominantly in large-bodied lineages. This suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. The study also suggests that these sounds may have been used for mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nIn conclusion, the research provides new insights into how dinosaurs might have sounded, challenging the popular image of them roaring like the T. rex in \"Jurassic Park.\" The study suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to today's birds, with closed-mouth vocalizations being a common feature among large-bodied species."]}

However, the brain activity measured in this study is just a fraction of the activity that lets us see moving images. Other, more complex areas help us interpret the content of those images.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, including the ability to control environments for paralyzed individuals by imagining sequences of movements. However, the use of such technology in court cases or detective work is still uncertain and would depend on how close those abstract visual experiences are to the real thing."]}
{"samples": [" The first passage discusses the proposed renaming of the Dryden Flight Research Center to the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center, sponsored by Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy. This proposal comes at a time when House Republicans are pursuing a strategy of deliberate idleness, with the House in session for only 20 out of 56 days in 2013. The Republicans are embracing the sequester, a 2.5 percent cut in all federal spending, rather than agreeing to tax increases. President Obama is calling for tax increases and alternative spending cuts to replace the automatic ones. The second passage discusses the concept of sequester, a term used to scare people into thinking the sky is falling. However, the author argues that the sequester is not as scary as politicians make it out to be, as it does not affect the salaries of senators and representatives. The author also criticizes the Congress for insisting on spending money on ineffective armaments and weapons systems."]}
{"samples": [" Senator Elizabeth Warren called for a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo executives over the cross-selling scandal, stating that reform won't come to the industry until executives are sent to jail. She accused CEO John Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" and demanded his resignation. Warren also criticized the culture that created the scandal, stating that employees were pushed to the breaking point to cheat customers and drive up the value of the company's stock.\n\nIn other news, Donald Trump is expected to announce that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a decision that has been met with predictable criticism. Pope Francis called on the United States to respect the status quo in Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital. The U.S. has historically insisted that Jerusalem\u2019s status be resolved in peace talks, and endorsing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital could potentially poison the well before talks have even begun.\n\nThe decision comes amidst a broader shift in Middle East politics. The New York Times reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority, with a peace plan that would be more tilted toward the Israelis than any ever embraced by the American government. The Palestinians would get a state of their own but only noncontiguous parts of the West Bank and only limited sovereignty over their own territory. The vast majority of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal, would remain. The Palestinians would not be given East Jerusalem as their capital and there would be no right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants."]}

The hacker claims to have stolen the first 10 episodes of the season and has already shared them on the Pirate Bay. Netflix has not confirmed the authenticity of the leaked episodes. The hacker also claims to have obtained unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic, and IFC, which were reportedly stolen in an attack on post-production studio Larson Studios in late 2016. Netflix has stated that a production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and that the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved. The hacker has demanded an unspecified sum of money from Netflix, but it's unclear what the motive for the theft and leak is."]}
{"samples": [" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has led to the use of Bayesian statistics to refine and focus the search for the plane. Bayesian statisticians use methods that allow them to update their estimates of the probability of finding the target in any latitude-longitude combination, even accounting for depth in the water. This approach has been used in previous search operations, such as hunting U-boats in World War II, a U.S. submarine in the 1960s, and an Air France jet in 2011.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 has been complicated by the cause of the disappearance, with new developments suggesting a deliberate diversion rather than an accident. This has affected the probability of finding the plane at any given location. Bayesian inference formalizes the process of assessing and assigning probabilities to new situations, updating estimates based on new information.\n\nThe search for the missing Air France Flight 447 in 2009 was aided by Bayesian techniques, which helped to narrow down the search area and eventually led to the discovery of the wreckage. However, the search for Flight 370 is more complex due to the lack of concrete evidence and the vast area to be searched.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bayesian techniques are seen as valuable in bringing discipline to the search process and adapting to changing information. However, there are concerns that people who use these tools without fully understanding them may be misled. The Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines are not using Bayesian methods in the current search, but are receiving assistance from a team of French government investigators who have experience with Bayesian methods."]}

The explosions were heard several miles away and shattered windows of nearby buildings. The army command building was in flames, sending thick black smoke over Damascus for hours. Witnesses reported heavy gunfire and panicked soldiers shooting in the air. The explosions were caused by a car bomb and an explosive device, with \"terrorists\" opening fire randomly. The Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011, has escalated into a civil war, with rebels increasingly targeting security sites and symbols of regime power. The U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for international action to stop the war, but Russia and China have vetoed Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to end the violence. In a separate incident, Press TV staff were attacked in Damascus, resulting in the death of correspondent Maya Naser and injury of Bureau Chief Hosein Mortada.

{"samples": [" The Sochi Winter Olympics present a significant security challenge for the United States, as evacuating over 200 American athletes from Russia would require Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval, which is unlikely. The U.S. military has plans to use two warships and planes in Europe to evacuate Americans if necessary. However, any rescue operation would heavily depend on Putin's approval. Fears of Olympic terror have grown, with Russia hunting for suspected terrorists and a militant video promising a \"surprise\" in Sochi. The U.S. Olympic Committee is working with the U.S. Department of State, local organizers, and law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of Team USA. Some American athletes are concerned about the security situation, with some even advising their families not to travel to Sochi. The U.S. ski and snowboard team has hired a private security firm, Global Rescue, for additional security. Russia has introduced extensive safeguards, with about 40,000 police officers and 70,000 soldiers patrolling the area. Despite these measures, some countries, including the U.S., have hired private security firms for their athletes."]}

The incident was part of an insurance scam to delay his prison term for a decade-long federal sentence from a high-profile mortgage fraud case. Egeland had directed his son to shoot him in the leg, which resulted in the amputation of his left leg. The additional sentence was due to Egeland's guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the insurance scam and for interstate failure to pay child support. Egeland, who has been in custody for 3 \u00bd years, has expressed remorse and is now taking mental health-related medications. The judge ordered him to pay the $90,011 he owes in child support and to seek mental health treatment and counseling while in prison."]}
